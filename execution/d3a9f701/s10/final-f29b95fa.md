# S10: unseen-source induction, observation evidence and settle-time coverage

- **Status:** T0 cross-slice contract for S10-A (pure contract and evaluator), S10-B (declaration,
  observation, persistence and routes), S10-C (facts/settle/status wiring) and S10-D (synthetic
  source and core-diff gate). Local draft 2, uncommitted; it revises draft 1 (sha256 `c5f6186e…`)
  per review `s10_0_review.md` findings 1-9. It changes no code, schema or API, claims nothing has
  run, and grants no builder, PG slot or review.
- **Date:** 2026-09-26. **Decision owner:** Bradley Gleave. The executing parent makes D-S10-1 to
  D-S10-8; they follow from the accepted documents and are not owner-reserved (§6 lists what is).
- **Current base:** `integration/importer` is `5407efae319fd913e973c87f3be0d49786c4a3e0` (S9-B
  landed, merge of `1e6e5735`). S9-C is not landed (draft `worktrees/d3a9-s9c-r2`). S10-C and S10-D
  bind to S9-C **as landed**, never to a candidate.
- **Citation trees.** Unprefixed `path Lx` is the historical tree `771db62aa10dd0065f30d7d8a155d89fd1cfcfc8`
  (S8-G landed, S9-A landed at `9497ca52`). This includes `src/scout/reconciliation/{types,coverage}.ts`,
  which are S9-A files present in that tree (`git ls-tree 771db62a src/scout/reconciliation`). Every
  unprefixed file cited here is byte-identical at `5407efae`. `5407efae:` marks files that exist
  only from S9-B (`facts.service.ts`). `S9C-draft:` marks the unlanded S9-C worktree.
- **Sources:** "S7L-DOC" `docs/decisions/2026-09-24-s7l-run-lifecycle.md`; "S8-DOC"
  `docs/decisions/2026-09-24-s8-native-contract.md`; "S9-DOC"
  `docs/decisions/2026-09-25-s9-reconciliation.md` L1-533 (landed text); "S9-ADD-A" its Addendum A,
  landed with S9-B (`5407efae:` same file L535-632).

## 1. Why this exists

S9 left `complete` unreachable until S10 supplies a per-family basis (S9-DOC L190-192). Seam:

- `CoverageFact {known, basis_kind, observed_unique, covers_staged_identities}`
  (`src/scout/reconciliation/types.ts` L207-220), read only by `coverage.ts` L35-82;
- S9-B passes `coverage: null` (`5407efae:src/scout/reconciliation/facts.service.ts` L478);
- S10 is the persistence re-decision trigger (S9-DOC L344-346).

Admission and mapping already need no per-source TypeScript (`src/scout/scout-platform.ts` L1-9;
`src/scout/reconstruct/source-mapper-registry.ts` L16-26, L50-66). The readiness gaps closed here:

- **G1:** no verifiable per-family observation contract;
- **G2:** no asset entry for native rule JSON (`nest-cli.json` L8-11 vs `native-rule-registry.ts`
  L9-12);
- **G3:** persistence must be settled before `complete`; **G4:** no induction gate or unseen proof.

A new canonical family, transformation or native destination is product-family expansion (out).

## 2. Decisions

### D-S10-1 (G1, G2, G4): the induction package and load-time validation

An induction package for one source is three data artifacts keyed by one canonical slug `<p>`
(`isCanonicalPlatform(p)`, never normalised; `scout-platform.ts` L1-9):

| Artifact | Path | Required | Grammar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mapping spec | `src/scout/reconstruct/sources/<p>.json` | yes | `SourceMappingSpec` v1, unchanged (`mapping-spec.ts` L114-125, L328-375) |
| Native rules | `src/scout/reconstruct/native/sources/<p>.json` | no | `NativeRuleSet` v1, unchanged (`native-rules.ts` L92-100) |
| Induction manifest | `src/scout/induction/sources/<p>.json` | no | `InductionManifestV1` (below), new |

```ts
interface InductionManifestV1 {
  manifestVersion: 1;
  sourcePlatform: string;              // === <p> === mapping spec sourcePlatform
  expectedFamilies: CanonicalFamily[]; // sorted, unique, non-empty
  basisKinds: Record<CanonicalFamily, BasisKind[]>; // keys === expectedFamilies; ⊆ D-S10-2 minus 'none'
  verifiers: { key_id: string; alg: 'ed25519'; public_key_b64: string }[]; // source trust anchors
  nativeRules: 'declared' | 'absent';
}
```

- **Declared expected family set.** It is the mapping spec's `families` keys, which S9 already
  treats as the declaration independent of the rows seen (S9-DOC L163-177; `types.ts` L228-235). The
  manifest restates it as `expectedFamilies`, and the two must be equal. `SourceMappingSpec` has
  strict keys (`mapping-spec.ts` L129-130, L337), so no key is added and `mapping-spec.ts` stays
  untouched.
- **Load-time validation** (S10-A `parse.ts`, `manifest-registry.ts`), fail closed and loud like
  `source-mapper-registry.ts` L50-66 and `native-rule-registry.ts` L23-52. **V1** strict keys,
  version 1, canonical slug, file named `<sourcePlatform>.json`. **V2** exactly one mapping spec
  for the slug and `expectedFamilies` equals its `families` keys; manifest without spec throws.
  **V3** `declared` ⇔ a rule set for the slug is loaded, its families ⊆ `expectedFamilies`; rule set
  without spec throws. **V4** `basisKinds` keys equal `expectedFamilies`, values unique kinds other
  than `none` (empty list = never provable). **V5** `verifiers` valid with unique `key_id`s;
  non-empty `basisKinds` requires ≥ 1 verifier. **V6** any duplicate throws naming the file; an
  absent `src/scout/induction/sources/` is an empty registry (precedent `native-rule-registry.ts`
  L14-24), a present-but-empty one throws; a mapping with no manifest reconstructs as today with
  every family `known: false`.
- **Verifier rule (finding 1; §6 Q2).** A verifier is a trust anchor for statements issued by the
  **source** (or by a server-side fetch that S10 does not build). A key whose private half the
  extension, a client or the coach device can use is an observer assertion, never a verifier.
  Custody is an **external manifest-approval fact** set by governance before a key enters
  `verifiers`, not inferable from signed bytes or the public key (Q1/Q2).
  Until Bradley decides Q2, **extension-asserted-only evidence is never a proving basis**. S10 ships
  no verifier for any real platform. The only verifier it ships is the synthetic `s10_unseen` test
  key (D-S10-5). Its private half exists only in named test fixtures.
- **Destinations.** Every canonical family already has a reconstructor (`families.ts` L174-179).
  `workouts` without native rules stays evidence, and client-owned rows stay bucket f (S9-DOC L110;
  S8-DOC L72-74). A package cannot declare a destination. A source that fits neither grammar is
  inducted as a truthful `partial`, never through a source branch.
- **G2 packaging.** S10-D D1 adds two generic `nest-cli.json` asset entries,
  `scout/reconstruct/native/sources/*.json` and `scout/induction/sources/*.json`. This is one-time
  work in the baseline, never per source.

### D-S10-2: run declaration, observation evidence and `basis_kind`

**Run-level declaration (findings 2 and 6).** Before the run's first staged row the coach's
authenticated client records the run's **authorized platform set** and, per platform, the
**expected account scope set** (the source accounts/workspaces authorized for this import, each as
`account_scope_id_digest`, sha256 of the source's scope id, never the raw id). It is immutable; the
server returns a per-run random 32-byte `challenge` that source statements must embed. Staging
never changes it: a staged row of an undeclared platform makes its families `known: false`, and a
declared platform or scope without proof is `known: false`. Multi-workspace: a platform may declare
several scopes and is exhaustive only when every declared scope is proven per family. Whether the
declared set is authoritative for the coach's source accounts is G3-AUTH/Q2; until decided it is a
local mechanism and production `complete` is deferred.

**Closed, append-only vocabulary.** `COMPLETENESS_BASIS_KINDS` (S9-DOC L217-218; S9-ADD-A A.2)
becomes `['none', 'source_signed_enumeration']`:

- `none` ⇔ `known: false`.
- `source_signed_enumeration` is one statement **issued and signed by the source** under a manifest
  verifier, covering one full `(platform, scope, family)` enumeration.
- A page-chain kind (per-page source-signed cursor/next-token links plus a signed terminal) is
  deferred (§5). It is not in the vocabulary, so any chain evidence is `known: false`.
- Appending a kind needs an addendum, an evaluator rule and negative cases. No kind is ever removed
  or renamed, and no kind names a source.
- Page counts, a source total, equal counts, an unsigned snapshot id or a `/complete` `success`
  never suffice (S9-DOC L186-189, L224-225).

```ts
interface SourceEnumerationStatementV1 {   // strict canonical JSON (below), signed by the source
  statement_version: 1;
  source_platform: string; account_scope_id_digest: string; family: CanonicalFamily;
  challenge_b64: string;                   // the run's declaration challenge (anti-replay)
  snapshot_ref_digest: string;             // 64 hex: sha256 of source snapshot/cursor ref
  date_window: null;                       // v1: unbounded only
  terminal: 'end_of_list';                 // source terminal marker for that snapshot
  observed_unique: number; id_set_digest: string;
  issued_at: string;                       // ISO; must fall within [accepted_start_at, received_at]
}
interface ObservationEvidenceV1 {          // what the client uploads, one per (platform, scope, family)
  evidence_version: 1;
  source_platform: string; account_scope_id_digest: string; family: CanonicalFamily;
  basis_kind: 'source_signed_enumeration';
  mapping_spec_digest: string;             // sha256 of the loaded spec's canonical JSON
  statement_b64: string; key_id: string; signature_b64: string; // opaque source artifact
}
```

- **Signed-artifact encoding (B-4).** `*_b64` fields are RFC 4648 §4 base64 (standard alphabet,
  padding, no whitespace); decode→re-encode must equal the input. The decoded statement is **strict
  canonical JSON**: UTF-8 without BOM, exactly the `SourceEnumerationStatementV1` keys (no extra,
  missing or duplicate), keys sorted by code point, no insignificant whitespace, integers only, and
  minimal string escaping; it must re-serialise to identical bytes. Ed25519 (RFC 8032) verifies
  over the **decoded canonical bytes**, never the base64 text. Bounds: statement ≤ 1024 bytes;
  signature 64, public key 32, challenge 32 bytes exactly; `key_id` `[a-z0-9._-]{1,64}`; digests 64
  lowercase hex; `observed_unique` integer in [0, 2^31-1]; `issued_at` RFC 3339 UTC ≤ 32 bytes. The
  snapshot reference is only the bounded digest; no raw source id, cursor or free text.
- **Server-bound fields, never client-supplied:** `coach_id` from the bearer, `intent_id`,
  `execution_epoch` (read under the run row lock), `received_at` and `evidence_digest` (sha256 of
  the canonical evidence).
- **Identity digest.** `id_set_digest` is sha256 over the bytewise-sorted distinct `source_id`s,
  each encoded `<utf8-byte-length>:<id>` (the length-prefix idea of S8-DOC L174-181). The empty
  set digests `""`. The **staged** side is computed from S9-B's own grouping (D-S10-3 E6), never
  re-derived.
- **Privacy and bounds.** Uploads carry digests, counts, the opaque statement, `key_id` and the
  signature. There is no raw source id, name, email, label or free text (S9-DOC L398-399). A body
  holds at most 4 families × declared scopes (`scout-reconstruct.dto.ts` L13-21) and is ≤ 32 KiB.
- **Trust.** The server verifies the source signature, the declaration binding and identity
  equality. An observer can withhold evidence (giving `known: false`) but cannot forge proof
  without the source key. A **genuinely source-signed false statement** (lying or compromised
  source, leaked key) is outside the evaluator's power: the trust boundary is the approved source
  key (owner Q1/Q2), and repeating a submission detects nothing.

### D-S10-3: the server evaluator (pure; S10-A `verify.ts`)

`evaluateCoverage(input) → Record<CanonicalFamily, CoverageFact>`. It is pure: no I/O, no clock and
no exceptions, like `arbiter.ts` L4-6. Its input is the run binding, the declaration, the
registries, the stored evidence at the settle epoch, and the staged digests and counts from E6. It
dispatches on `basis_kind` only.

**Emitted families:** every `expectedFamilies` entry of every **declared** platform plus every
family of an undeclared staged platform. Map keys enter S9's `required_families` (`coverage.ts`
L69), so a declared but unstaged source cannot disappear; a zero-staged run stays undeterminable
(L66), never vacuous.

**Proof unit.** Each `(declared platform, declared scope, family)` is one unit. The rules apply in
order, and the first failure makes the unit unproven:

- **E1 (declaration).** A declaration exists and names the platform and scope; a staged row of an
  undeclared platform, or no declaration, makes that family `known: false`.
- **E2 (presence and grammar).** Exactly one evidence row exists for the unit and parses as v1. An
  absent row gives `known: false`, never `observed_unique: 0`.
- **E3 (binding).** Coach, intent and epoch equal the settling run (`lifecycle.service.ts`
  L335-338). The manifest exists, `family ∈ expectedFamilies`, `basis_kind ∈ basisKinds[family]`,
  and `mapping_spec_digest` equals the loaded spec's digest.
- **E4 (source verification).** `key_id` is a manifest verifier, the encoding rules hold, and the
  Ed25519 signature over the decoded canonical statement bytes verifies. The statement's
  platform, scope, family and `challenge_b64` equal the unit and the run's challenge;
  `date_window === null`, `terminal === 'end_of_list'`, `issued_at` within the run window. Any
  mismatch (including a narrower or different scope) fails the unit.
- **E5 (unit proven).** E1-E4 hold; `observed_unique` is the statement's count (may be 0).

**Family fact.** `known: true` only if every declared unit of every declared platform for the
family is proven and E1 raised no failure; then `basis_kind: 'source_signed_enumeration'`,
`observed_unique` = sum over units, and `covers_staged_identities` = E6 holds for every platform
(evidence must agree within a platform, never across platforms). Otherwise `{known: false}`.

**E6 (staged-identity coverage).**

- Staged digest and count per `(platform, family)` are computed inside S9-B's facts service from
  **its own grouping** — `resolveFamily`, which falls back from `resolveStagedFamily` to "token
  equals a spec family" (`5407efae:src/scout/reconciliation/facts.service.ts` L484-493, used at
  L498). S10-C exports that one function and digests the rows it already groups, so evaluator and
  reconciler share one partition; any family-set disagreement fails closed (`known: false`).
- Staged rows carry no scope, so a single-scope platform attributes all its rows to its one scope.
  A platform with several declared scopes cannot be matched to staged identities in v1 and is
  `known: false` (attribution deferred, §5), never merged by count.
- `covers_staged_identities` iff digest and count both equal staged. Equal digest with unequal count
  is inconsistent → `known: false`. Unequal digest → `known: true, covers_staged_identities: false`
  (S9 shows the count with `'none'`, C-COV holds; `coverage.ts` L37-45).

**Composition.** The evaluator is total, and a family it cannot evaluate gets `{known: false}`. S9
keeps the claim rule (`coverage.ts` L37) and the empty/undeterminable rules (L64-66, L78-82). S10
edits neither `coverage.ts` nor `reconcile.ts`. Unknown is `known: false` or `null`, and never 0
(S9-DOC L288-289; S7L-DOC L208-212).

### D-S10-4 (G3): persistence — three insert-only tables, marked S10-B T4

S9's no-table justification rested on `complete` being unreachable (S9-DOC L329-343); S10 makes it
reachable, firing the re-decision trigger (S9-DOC L344-346), and declaration and evidence must
survive across instances until settle. **Decision: three additive tables, built only by S10-B as
a T4 expand; this document creates none.**

- **`ScoutRunDeclaration`:** `coach_id`, `intent_id`, `source_platform`, `account_scope_id_digest`,
  `challenge bytea(32)`, `declared_at`; unique `(coach_id, intent_id, source_platform,
  account_scope_id_digest)`; one run's rows share one challenge and `declared_at` (one statement;
  a trigger refuses a differing challenge).
- **`ScoutRunObservation`:** `id`, `coach_id`, `intent_id`, `execution_epoch`, `source_platform`,
  `account_scope_id_digest`, `family`, `basis_kind`, `evidence jsonb` (validated upload),
  `evidence_digest char(64)`, `received_at`; unique on all binding columns except `id`.
- **`ScoutRunSettledBasis`:** PK `(coach_id, intent_id)`, `execution_epoch`, `report_version`,
  `report jsonb` (settle-time report with coverage fields; S9-DOC L247-289),
  `observation_digests text[]`, `settled_at`.
- **Tenant/FK.** Composite FK `(coach_id, intent_id)` → `ScoutImport(coach_id, intent_id)`
  (`prisma/schema.prisma` L6894): a row for another coach's intent is unrepresentable.
- **Deletion (findings 4, B-2).** Guaranteed only: DELETE and UPDATE are REVOKEd from every
  runtime role (anon, authenticated, `service_role`); a `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger raises
  for top-level statements (`pg_trigger_depth() = 1`); a parent-run delete removes children by
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Depth > 1 is a nesting test, not proof of an FK action: a nested DELETE by
  a privileged (owner/superuser) trigger is **not** excluded and is reserved to database
  governance. The cascade is **referential cleanup only**, for a parent run deleted under a
  separately authorized L8 policy; it is not a retention or erasure authorization. Today the run is
  `RESTRICT`-bound to its intent and account erasure tombstones the `User` (S7L-DOC L257-263), so
  all rows stay in place pending Q3. S10 chooses no retention interval; S10-B proves the R31
  controls in a disposable PG.
- **RLS.** Copy the ImportNativeProvenance set exactly (ENABLE + FORCE, REVOKE anon/authenticated,
  one service_role policy, RESTRICTIVE deny-all;
  `prisma/migrations/20270122000000_scout_native_provenance_expand/migration.sql` L168-182); every
  access filters on the bearer's `coach_id`; the down migration refuses while any row exists
  (S7L-DOC L273).
- **Settle write (S10-C).** In the S8-G settle transaction after `writeTerminal` returns true
  (`lifecycle.service.ts` L334-347), so one locked snapshot and epoch serve facts, evaluator and
  CAS. A CAS miss writes nothing; an insert failure rolls back the terminal; the `fence` path
  (L274-298) writes nothing.
- **Status.** With a settled basis, report and `families[]` come from it with `basis: 'settled'`
  (one additive literal in the `types.ts` basis union); without one (legacy, pre-S10, fence-path
  terminals) S9 recompute-on-read stays `'recomputed'`, byte-identical to S9-C. A stored `complete`
  never meets a later recomputed contradiction.
- **Rejected:** `ScoutImportCompletion.final_counts` (the claim, S7L-DOC L212; open-shaped,
  `scout.dto.ts` L143-150; not epoch-bound); columns on `ScoutImport` (widens the hot CAS row,
  `schema.prisma` L6857-6895, `lifecycle.service.ts` L370-384); no persistence (violates the trigger).

**Routes (S10-B)** in new `src/scout/induction/observation.controller.ts`, `run.controller.ts`
posture (coach = `req.user.id`, R-DARK-1 uniform 404, `@Roles('coach','owner')`, same throttle;
L22-27, L88-91); both write under `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` on the run row (`lifecycle.service.ts`
L357-363), open `mode='server'` runs only:

- `POST /api/scout/runs/declaration` `{intent_id, platforms: [{source_platform,
  account_scope_id_digests[]}]}` → `challenge`: **one atomic transaction under the run lock**
  inserts the whole set or nothing. `platforms` non-empty, unique canonical slugs; each scope array
  non-empty, unique, 64 hex; else 400, no row (an empty list never means "declared"). One
  server-generated 32-byte challenge is stored identically in every row. Exact replay (order
  ignored) → 200 with the **original** challenge; any changed, removed or appended platform/scope →
  409 `declaration_conflict`, before or after ingest; a first declaration after the first staged
  row → 409 `declaration_after_ingest` (ingest's §3.1 gate serialises on the same row).
- `POST /api/scout/runs/observation` `{intent_id, observations: ObservationEvidenceV1[]}`; only
  after a declaration and before the claim; binds the current epoch. Identical replay → 200, no row.
- Refusals reuse `RUN_CONFLICT_CODES` unedited (`reason-codes.ts` L35-42) plus closed
  `OBSERVATION_CONFLICT_CODES = ['declaration_conflict', 'declaration_after_ingest',
  'declaration_missing', 'observation_conflict', 'observation_after_claim',
  'observation_not_declared']` in `src/scout/induction/contract.ts`.

### D-S10-5 (G4): CORE DIFF = 0, baseline and the synthetic unseen-source test

- **Baseline B** is the full 40-hex `integration/importer` commit landing S10-A, S10-B, S10-C (with
  generator-owner regeneration) and S10-D D1 (two `nest-cli.json` asset entries,
  `scripts/s10-core-diff-gate.sh`). B is recorded immutably in the D2 grant; it is neither
  `771db62a` nor `5407efae`. One-time generic code is excluded by being in B, not by being hidden.
- **Allowed per-source delta (exactly; the three JSONs must all be present):**
  `src/scout/reconstruct/sources/s10_unseen.json`, `src/scout/reconstruct/native/sources/s10_unseen.json`,
  `src/scout/induction/sources/s10_unseen.json`,
  `test/fixtures/scout/s10_unseen/{staged-rows,statements,signer-test-key}.json`,
  `test/scout/s10/{s10-unseen.e2e.spec.ts,s10-unseen.pg.spec.ts}`.
- **Gate (D2, parent-run; any failure or tool exit ≥ 2 fails):** (1) `git merge-base --is-ancestor
  <B> HEAD`; (2) `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` empty; (3) `git diff --name-only
  <B> HEAD` equals the allowed set exactly; (4) `git diff --exit-code <B> HEAD -- . ':!<each
  allowed path>'` (bytewise for every other path: `src`, `prisma`, `scripts`, `docs/contracts`,
  `nest-cli.json`, package files); (5) `rg -F -l s10_unseen src --type ts` exits 1 (exit 0 or ≥ 2
  fails); (6) the same over B's `src/` exits 1; (7) `RUN_REASON_CODES`, `COMPLETENESS_BASIS_KINDS`,
  `OBSERVATION_CONFLICT_CODES` and `docs/contracts/importer-openapi.json` unchanged; (8) three
  negative controls on scratch branches, never landed (planted slug literal in a core file; dirty
  modified core file; untracked `src/` file) each fail the gate.
- **Synthetic `s10_unseen`.** Spec declares `clients`, `programs`, `workouts` (two steps into
  `workouts` under `sharedIdSpaces`), stages one declared family by canonical token without a
  `steps` entry, and leaves `client_history` undeclared. Registration is dispatch, not
  authorization (`source-mapper-registry.ts` L84-86; precedent `conformance_alpha.json`). The
  synthetic signer stands in for a **source** and is verified exactly as a real source key would
  be: this proves the mechanism, not any real platform's completeness (Q1, Q2). Real-PG
  end-to-end: declaration → staging → S8-G pass → native/evidence → observation → evaluator → S9
  verdict → settled basis → status.

### D-S10-6: invariants (asserted by S10 specs; S7-L, S8 and S9 invariants unchanged)

1. **No false Complete.** S9's full predicate (no C-FAM/C-ID/C-REL, claim `success`; S9-DOC
   L147-161) plus a source-verified, covering fact for every required family over every declared
   platform and scope; an empty or undeterminable set is never vacuous (S9-DOC L182-184).
   Extension-asserted-only evidence never proves (Q2).
2. **Unknown is never zero.** Absent, invalid, unverified or undeclared basis → `known: false` /
   `coverage: null` and `observed_unique: null`; `0` is only a source-verified count.
3. **No duplicate native identity.** Ledger identity (`schema.prisma` L6996) and provenance key
   (L7023) unchanged; id spaces merge only via declared `sharedIdSpaces`; no new native writer.
4. **No cross-tenant reads or writes.** All three tables are keyed and FK-bound by the bearer's
   `coach_id`; the staged digest reuses S9-B's coach- and intent-scoped rows.
5. **No customer-facing side effects.** S8 create-only and §3.6 suppression apply unchanged (S8-DOC
   L104-112, L223-242); the induction module imports no notification, drip, email, messaging,
   workout-builder, AI or billing module (R38).
6. **The S9 arbiter stays the sole terminal writer** (`arbiter.ts` L64-88; one CAS,
   `lifecycle.service.ts` L370-384). S10 writes no `terminal_status`, `reason_code` or
   `completed_at`; the basis row is a record after the CAS, never a second verdict.
7. **Declaration, evidence and basis are immutable and run/epoch-bound**; other runs' rows are inert.

### D-S10-7: slices, owned paths, tiers and dependencies (one writer per path)

Tiers: T0 decision; T1 pure data/parser; T2 synthetic composition; T3 API/packaging; T4 terminal
truth, schema, tenant and real PG, with independent review.

| Slice | Tier | Owned paths | Depends on | Not owned |

| S10-B | T3/T4 | `src/scout/induction/{observation.service,observation.controller,observation.dto,observation.module}.ts`; `prisma/schema.prisma` (three additive models only); `prisma/migrations/<ts>_scout_run_observation_expand/{migration,down}.sql`; `test/scout/induction/observation.{service,controller}.spec.ts`; `test/rls-g2-s10b.spec.ts`; `test/utils/g2-s10b-*` | S10-A landed; PG proof only in the canonical slot; merges after S9-C lands | `scout.module.ts` registration, the settle path, OpenAPI bytes |
| S10-C | T4 | `src/scout/reconciliation/facts.service.ts` (export `resolveFamily` as the shared classifier; staged digests from its own grouping; coverage from the evaluator instead of `coverage: null`); `src/scout/lifecycle/lifecycle.service.ts` (settled-basis insert after `writeTerminal`; `readReport` prefers the settled basis; **`projectFamilies`/`projectToken` fill `observed_unique`**, `S9C-draft:` L731-805, per the rule below); `src/scout/reconciliation/types.ts` (`'settled'` literal only); `src/scout/scout.module.ts` (ObservationModule import only); added cases in `test/scout/{reconciliation,lifecycle,induction}/**`; `test/rls-g2-s10c.spec.ts`; Gen in the same change via the **generator owner only** (`scripts/importer-contract.ts`, `docs/contracts/importer-openapi.json`, `test/contracts/importer-contract.spec.ts`) | **after S9-C lands** (it owns those lifecycle hunks until then; `s9c_builder_summary.md` L31-36, L64-72), plus S10-A and S10-B | `reconcile.ts`, `coverage.ts`, `arbiter.ts`, `reason-codes.ts` |

**`observed_unique` projection rule (finding 7).** Without a settled basis `projectFamilies` keeps
`null`. With one, `projectToken` sets the token's `observed_unique` to the holder family's value
only if exactly one report family holds the token, it is mapped, the token is its only token and
the value is non-null; otherwise (several holders, shared family, unknown) `null`, never a split or
estimate. R37 asserts status equals the stored report for one and for several holders.

S10-A/B are disjoint from S9-C's 18 paths (`s9c_builder_summary.md` L10-29). S10-C takes S9-C's
files only after they land, so ownership is sequential. S10-A freezes to this text once it lands.

### D-S10-8: what stays generic and closed

No new run reason code (an unproven run stays `partial/coverage_basis_unknown`, S9-DOC L362-366),
no report catalogue key (S9-DOC L381-400); evaluator failures show only as `completeness_basis:
'none'` with `observed_unique` a count or `null`. No source-name literal enters `src/**/*.ts`.

## 3. Acceptance cases (fixed; numbering continues S9's R01-R19)

Tiers: "A" pure S10-A spec; "B" S10-B real-PG proof; "C" S10-C composed settle/status on PG; "D"
S10-D synthetic end-to-end and gate. No accepted suite is rerun; S9 R01-R19 still pass.

- **R20 (A)** A valid synthetic package loads; one throwing case each for V1-V6; absent directory
  → empty registry; present-but-empty throws; `basisKinds` without a verifier throws.
- **R21 (A)** Rejects: unknown key/version; non-hex digest; negative count; unknown `basis_kind`
  (incl. page-chain); body > 32 KiB; non-canonical base64 (whitespace, no padding, URL alphabet);
  non-canonical JSON (unsorted, whitespace, duplicate/extra/missing key, BOM, non-integer); statement
  > 1024 bytes; signature/key/challenge of wrong length; `snapshot_ref_digest` not 64 hex;
  `issued_at` not RFC 3339 UTC; a signature over the base64 text rather than decoded bytes.
- **R22 (A)** Every declared unit with a valid source signature, matching challenge/scope/family
  and digest+count equal to staged → `{known: true, basis_kind: 'source_signed_enumeration',
  observed_unique: n, covers_staged_identities: true}`.
- **R23 (A)** Valid statement, digest ≠ staged → `known: true, covers_staged_identities: false` →
  `partial/coverage_basis_unknown`.
- **R24 (A, finding 1, B-1)** Each alone → `known: false`, `observed_unique: null`: (a) no
  signature or `key_id` not an approved verifier; (b) no manifest or `basis_kind ∉
  basisKinds[family]`; (c) one altered byte of the decoded statement; (d) challenge ≠ the run's
  (replay from another run); (e) evidence row bound to another coach, intent or epoch; (f)
  statement platform, scope or family ≠ the unit (incl. narrower scope); (g) `issued_at` outside
  [`accepted_start_at`, `received_at`]; (h) non-null `date_window` or `terminal` ≠ `end_of_list`;
  (i) spec-digest mismatch; (j) equal digest with count ≠ staged; (k) any page-chain payload
  (unknown `basis_kind`). Out of scope by construction (D-S10-2 Trust): a correctly signed false
  statement under an approved key, and key custody (a manifest-approval fact, Q1/Q2).
- **R25 (A, findings 2, 6)** Each alone → family `known: false`: no declaration; statement scope
  different from or narrower than the declared scope; a declared scope unproven;
  a platform with two declared scopes (v1, E6); staged row of an undeclared platform; declared platform
  with zero staged rows and no proof. A declared unstaged platform's families are in
  `required_families`.
- **R26 (A)** Declared family, zero staged rows, verified statement with `observed_unique: 0` and
  the empty-set digest → known and covered; no evidence → `known: false` →
  `coverage_basis_unknown` (S9-DOC L174-176).
- **R27 (A, finding 3)** A canonical-family token staged without a `steps` entry is counted in the
  staged digest exactly as S9-B groups it (`5407efae:…/facts.service.ts` L484-493); a forced
  disagreement between evaluator family set and S9-B grouping → `known: false`.
- **R28 (A)** Metamorphic: a renamed slug gives identical facts; no slug literal in
  `src/scout/induction/*.ts`.
- **R29 (B)** Declaration: accepted with zero staged rows, one shared challenge; empty `platforms`,
  empty/duplicate scopes or duplicate platform → 400, no row; reordered exact replay → 200, original
  challenge, no row; changed/removed/appended set → `declaration_conflict` before and after ingest;
  first declaration after a staged row → `declaration_after_ingest`; injected mid-insert failure
  rolls back all rows. Observation before declaration → `declaration_missing`; identical replay →
  200, no new row; different digest → `observation_conflict`; after claim →
  `observation_after_claim`; fenced → `run_fenced`; terminal → `run_terminal`; legacy →
  `legacy_run`; no manifest → `observation_not_declared`; other coach's intent or flag off → 404.
- **R30 (B)** Observation rows store the epoch read under the lock; a settle at e' ≠ e ignores them.
- **R31 (B, findings 4, B-2)** All three tables: anon/authenticated refused; service_role rollback
  persists nothing; coach B cannot read/write A's rows and the FK refuses them; UPDATE and direct
  service_role DELETE refused (REVOKE + trigger); **negative control:** a non-FK child DELETE issued
  from a nested trigger/function in a service_role session is refused (no privilege); **positive
  control:** deleting a parent run in a disposable PG cascades its children only; a differing
  challenge within one run's declaration refused; down refuses with rows; catalog exactness.
- **R32 (B)** A declaration racing the first ingest, and an observation racing `/complete`,
  serialise on the row lock: used, or refused with its code; never partial, never 40P01.
- **R33 (C)** Native-clean run, fully declared and verified, claim `success` → `complete`,
  `reason_code` null, exactly one terminal write and one settled-basis row in the same transaction
  with `'settled'`.
- **R34 (C)** Full coverage plus C-FAM/C-ID/C-REL → that S9 code; claim `partial`/`failed` with
  staged rows → `coverage_basis_unknown`; a fence wins.
- **R35 (C)** After R33, archive a native row and replay the identity in a later intent: status
  still `complete`, settled report byte-identical to settle time.
- **R36 (C)** CAS miss or injected basis-insert failure → no terminal from this tail, no basis row;
  left for the lazy deadline.
- **R37 (C, finding 7)** Legacy/pre-S10 terminals project exactly as S9-C (S9 R13, R15); with a
  settled basis `families[].observed_unique` equals the stored report under the D-S10-7 rule for
  one holder (number) and multiple holders or a shared family (`null`); 64 KiB bound holds.
- **R38 (C)** Notification, drip, email and messaging spies record zero calls across import,
  replay, declaration and observations.
- **R39 (D)** `s10_unseen` on real PG: (a) all declared units verified → `complete`; (b)
  `nativeRules: 'absent'` → `partial/unresolved_identities`; (c) client-linked row → `partial`;
  (d) staged undeclared `client_history` → `unresolved_family`; (e) one declared family unproven
  → `coverage_basis_unknown`; (f) extension-signed statement only → `coverage_basis_unknown`.
- **R40 (D, finding 5)** The D-S10-5 gate passes on D2 against the pinned B; all three negative
  controls fail it.
- **R41 (D)** Replaying the intent creates no second native row; two steps into one family without
  `sharedIdSpaces` fail at load.

## 4. Owner-reserved boundary (S10 needs none; none decided here)

Per `private-evidence/execution/daceddc8/SCOPE.md` L5: live source-account login, extraction or
customer-account writes (S10 uses synthetic identities and a synthetic source signer only);
production deployment, `FEATURE_SCOUT_*` flags, customer enablement, destructive production
mutation; `integration/importer` → `main` (PR #530); extension approval/publishing (PR #27, #30)
and the Chrome Web Store (read-only interface context, not operated); S8-D/S8-E client-principal
policy (D-S8-2, S8-DOC L84-89) and G3-AUTH (S8-DOC L96-101); security governance and branch
protection.

## 5. What is NOT decided (deferred; not owner-reserved unless §6)

A page-chain basis kind (per-page source-signed cursor/next-token links plus signed terminal, and
id-set composition across pages); a server-side-fetch verifier; staged-row scope attribution
(multi-scope platforms); real-platform capability (stays unknown); per-family
"why unknown" codes; native drift beside a settled verdict; N3-FILL attribution and the
created/already-present split (S9-DOC L227-239); canonical-family expansion; value-drift
fingerprints (S9-D); coach-facing copy (UX-05); a `CONTRACT_VERSION` bump (additive per the S8-F
precedent, `s9c_builder_summary.md` L72; generator owner confirms).

## 6. Questions believed genuinely owner-reserved (recorded, not decided)

- **Q1.** Whether/when any real platform gets a manifest, basis kind and source verifier.
- **Q2.** Whether anything short of a source-signed or server-fetched basis may back a
  customer-visible `complete`. Until decided, extension-asserted-only evidence never proves and
  production `complete` is not enabled.
- **Q3.** L8 retention period and erasure semantics for the three tables; rows stay under today's
  tombstoning; the cascade is referential cleanup only (S7L-DOC L257-263).
- **Q4.** Any extension change to emit declarations or relay source statements (PR #27, #30, CWS).
- **Q5.** D-S8-2 end state and G3-AUTH, including whether the declared scope set is authoritative
  for the coach's source accounts; until then client-owned families block `complete`.

## 7. Release boundary

A local contract for S10-A to S10-D; passing R20-R41 proves local candidate behaviour only.
Builder grants, the PG slot and reviews are separate parent decisions; deployment, customer
acceptance, flags and any `main` merge stay owner-reserved (S7L-DOC L284-286).
