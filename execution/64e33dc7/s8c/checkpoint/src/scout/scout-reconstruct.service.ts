/**
 * IMPORTER-F + IMPORTER-H — reconstruct a settled crawl intent's staged entities
 * of one family into canonical records (D2, Op 59 + Op 63). The `clients` family
 * reconstructs into invite-pending, non-login, tenant-owned roster `Person`
 * records; non-person families (`workouts`, `client_history`) reconstruct into
 * the generic canonical `ScoutReconstructedEntity` table. The engine is keyed on
 * entity_type via a family registry — ONE parameterized mechanism, no cloned
 * pipelines.
 *
 * Guarantees (family-independent — the engine owns them, not the family):
 *  - Post-settle only: a still-running intent is rejected (no partial import).
 *  - Fail-closed family: an unregistered entity_type is a 400 before any read.
 *  - Bounded fan-out: staged rows are counted first, an over-ceiling intent is
 *    rejected fail-closed, and the rest are read one deterministic page at a
 *    time — never the whole roster at once and never an unbounded query burst.
 *  - Idempotent: the canonical target is keyed on the tenant-scoped external_ref
 *    and the ledger on the wide identity (coach_id, intent_id, entity_type,
 *    source_platform, source_id), both upserted, so a replay mints no new rows
 *    and returns identical counts. A concurrent replay that loses the insert
 *    race (unique violation) is retried once and converges, never a spurious
 *    `failed`. A unique violation that persists after the retry cannot be the
 *    wide identity (the retry's upsert would have matched it): it is an
 *    unexpected unique violation (G2-C: no narrow key remains) and is a 409
 *    with nothing written, never a fabricated ledger outcome.
 *  - Poison-row isolation: each staged row is reconstructed in its own
 *    transaction inside a try/catch; one bad row is recorded `failed` and its
 *    siblings still reconstruct.
 *  - Honest accounting: counts are read back from the durable ledger, so
 *    `staged === reconstructed + skipped + failed` always holds.
 *  - No credential is ever minted and email is never used as a key.
