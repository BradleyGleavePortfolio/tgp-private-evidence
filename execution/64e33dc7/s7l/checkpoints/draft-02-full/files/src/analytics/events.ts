/**
 * Canonical PostHog event taxonomy for the Growth Project backend.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for server-side event names. The
 * names are used both by AnalyticsService.capture() callers and by the
 * /admin/metrics endpoint which exposes the same counters via Postgres.
 *
 * The taxonomy is aligned to the "metrics_dashboard_spec" lanes:
 *   - INVITE_FUNNEL: how many codes resolve, how many convert into signups,
 *     how many of those signups attach to a coach
 *   - SIGNUP: account creation across email + Google
 *   - COACH: provisioning a CoachProfile (the moment a coach can take clients)
 *   - BILLING: Stripe subscription lifecycle mirrored from webhooks
 *   - AI: server-side chat invocations, including fallback rate
 *   - MESSAGING: coach <-> client messages sent
 *   - CLIENT_LOG: aggregate client logging activity (food, etc.)
 *
 * Event names use snake_case nouns with verb suffixes so they sort sensibly
 * in PostHog. NEVER include PII in event names (no email, no full names).
 *
 * No fake revenue or fake customer metrics are emitted from these events;
 * billing-tier amounts come straight from Stripe webhook payloads and are
 * the only "money" properties allowed.
