# S7-3' G2 C old-side fixture: create (or preflight) the detached checkout of the accepted N/Q1
# head (the N writer / Q1 readers / R schema with both narrow keys still declared) that
# test/utils/g2-c-bootstrap.sh step 4 requires. Derived by substitution from the accepted N/Q1
# helper test/utils/g2-nq1-old-root.sh (unchanged): the same clone + detached checkout recipe,
# with the identity gate moved to the N/Q1 head: the old root MUST carry E and R, MUST NOT carry
# C, and carries N's REQUIRED ledger provenance plus both narrow `@@unique` declarations.
# OLD_HEAD is a placeholder until the parent records N/Q1 acceptance (phase 2 fill).
#
# Why this exists: a `git archive | tar` extraction is NOT a Git repository, so it can
# never satisfy bootstrap's identity gate (`git rev-parse HEAD` == the N/Q1 head and a clean
# relevant-path diff). The fixture must be a real detached checkout. This script clones
# the candidate root itself (which must contain the N/Q1 head in its history) and checks out
# it detached, changing no ref, worktree
# metadata or file of the candidate repository. It then runs the exact offline checks
# bootstrap will repeat, so the recipe is verified before any database or dependency work.
#
# Usage: G2_C_OLD_ROOT=<path> bash test/utils/g2-c-old-root.sh [create|preflight]
#   create     (default) clone + detached checkout at the N/Q1 head when the path does not exist,
#              then preflight. Refuses to reuse a path that is not that checkout.
#   preflight  only verify an existing path.
# Optional: G2_C_OLD_ROOT_SHARED=1 uses `git clone --shared` (objects read through
#   alternates from the candidate's object store; zero copy). Default is a self-contained
#   local clone (hardlinked/copied objects) that keeps working if the source moves.
# Needs git only. Never deletes anything; never touches PostgreSQL, node_modules, hosted
# or customer resources.
