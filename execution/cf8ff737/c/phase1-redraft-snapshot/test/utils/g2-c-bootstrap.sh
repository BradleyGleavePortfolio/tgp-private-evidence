# The "old" side is N/Q1: a detached checkout of the accepted N/Q1 head (N writer, Q1 readers,
# R schema, narrow keys still declared); its `prisma migrate deploy` installs the whole accepted
# history (S1..R, 169) so the C candidate has EXACTLY C pending. C is NOT applied here: the spec
# applies it through the candidate's `prisma migrate deploy` (the release mechanism, C01).
# Validation harness only: it never touches a hosted or application database, never edits
# schema/migration/generator sources, and stops on the first unexpected state instead of
# repairing it.
