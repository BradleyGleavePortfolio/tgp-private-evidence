# S8-B G2 OLD fixture: create (or preflight) the detached checkout of the S8-B base head
# (OLD_HEAD below: the accepted N/Q1 head 29e60705 while S8-B is drafted on it; re-pinned to the
# accepted C head by the mechanical rebase before the PG run) that test/utils/g2-s8b-bootstrap.sh
# step 4 requires. Derived by substitution from the committed N/Q1 helper
# test/utils/g2-nq1-old-root.sh (blob 4569f5fe at 61b93cff, unchanged): the same clone +
# detached checkout recipe; the identity gate here requires the OLD root to carry E, R and the
# pre-S8-B schema (no ImportNativeProvenance model, no ledger target_kind) while the candidate
# ships exactly S8-B.
#
# Why this exists: a `git archive | tar` extraction is NOT a Git repository, so it can
# never satisfy bootstrap's identity gate (`git rev-parse HEAD` == T and a clean
# relevant-path diff). The fixture must be a real detached checkout. This script clones
# the candidate root itself (which must contain the R head in its history) and checks out
# it detached, changing no ref, worktree
# metadata or file of the candidate repository. It then runs the exact offline checks
# bootstrap will repeat, so the recipe is verified before any database or dependency work.
#
# Usage: G2_S8B_OLD_ROOT=<path> bash test/utils/g2-s8b-old-root.sh [create|preflight]
#   create     (default) clone + detached checkout at OLD_HEAD when the path does not exist,
#              then preflight. Refuses to reuse a path that is not that checkout.
#   preflight  only verify an existing path.
# Optional: G2_S8B_OLD_ROOT_SHARED=1 uses `git clone --shared` (objects read through
#   alternates from the candidate's object store; zero copy). Default is a self-contained
#   local clone (hardlinked/copied objects) that keeps working if the source moves.
# Needs git only. Never deletes anything; never touches PostgreSQL, node_modules, hosted
# or customer resources.
