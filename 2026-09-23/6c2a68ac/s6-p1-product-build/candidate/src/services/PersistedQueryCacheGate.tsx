// PersistedQueryCacheGate — identity boundary for the persisted React Query
// cache (S6-P1).
//
// Replaces the import-time PersistQueryClientProvider composition, whose
// persister key was fixed at module load (always ':anonymous' on
// AsyncStorage-shim builds) and could not follow the signed-in identity.
//
// Contract:
//   `userId` is the COMMITTED bootstrap identity supplied by RootNavigator:
//     undefined — bootstrap outcome unknown yet: nothing is read, written,
//                 cleared or purged; children stay unmounted;
//     null      — committed logged-out: memory is cleared and every persisted
//                 cache key is purged before unauthenticated children mount;
//                 nothing is persisted while logged out;
//     string    — committed user: that user's own key is restored (bounded)
//                 before that user's children mount, then kept in sync.
//
//   Children are rendered only while `committed === userId`. Any identity
//   change therefore unmounts the previous identity's children in the same
//   React commit that schedules the transition effect — structurally, no
//   replacement child can ever observe the previous identity's memory, and the
//   previous children's observers have detached before the cache is cleared.
//
//   Transition order (explicit, same for A→B, A→null, null→A, interrupted):
//     1. retire the previous persistence (unsubscribe + write fence)
//     2. drain its in-flight storage writes (bounded)
//     3. settleAndClearQueryCache() — cancel fetches, detach observers, clear
//     4. null: purge every persisted cache key;  user: restore own key (bounded)
//     5. commit → children mount
//   A transition that is superseded mid-flight stops at its next checkpoint
//   and never commits; the superseding transition retires whatever the
//   superseded one had created. Late completions of a retired persistence are
//   fenced inside createIdentityPersistence (restore→hydrate boundary, actual
//   setItem, fail-closed removal after an expired drain).
