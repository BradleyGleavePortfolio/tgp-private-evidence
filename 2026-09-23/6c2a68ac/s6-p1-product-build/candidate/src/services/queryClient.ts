// React Query client configuration.
//
// We picked tanstack/react-query as the data layer for the API-first migration
// (Fix #2) for three reasons:
//
//   1. Caching + automatic background revalidation give us the "feels native"
//      offline experience the audit asked for without us hand-rolling a
//      sync engine. A user opening their Habits screen sees the last cached
//      list immediately while a fresh fetch runs in the background.
//
//   2. Mutations + automatic invalidation mean a coach posting a new nudge
//      and a client opening their Notifications screen see consistent state
//      with one line of `queryClient.invalidateQueries`. Previously every
//      screen wrote to its own SQLite table and there was no way to keep
//      two surfaces in sync.
//
//   3. Centralized retry policy. Network blips on a phone are normal; we
//      retry idempotent reads twice with exponential backoff and no retry
//      on mutations (the api.ts interceptor already coalesces 401s and
//      handles refresh).
//
// The defaults below intentionally err toward fewer network calls because
// the user base is mobile and metered. Screens that need always-fresh data
// can opt in per-query with `refetchOnWindowFocus: true` and shorter
// staleTime — see HabitsScreen for an example.

/**
 * Persisted React Query cache — identity-bound (S6-P1).
 *
 * Why we persist the cache:
 *   On a cold start the user opens the app and we have to wait for the network
 *   round-trip before showing anything. With persistence, we hydrate the cache
 *   from disk on boot and the first paint shows last-known data while a fresh
 *   fetch runs in the background.
 *
 * What we DON'T persist:
 *   Mutations are intentionally not persisted. A pending mutation surviving
 *   an app restart could double-create rows (e.g. a workout logged twice if
 *   the user force-quit mid-network). Re-issuing those is the queue's job
 *   (foodLogQueue.ts), not the query cache's. Queries tagged with
 *   `meta: { persist: false }` are evicted before write.
 *
 * Cache TTL:
 *   24h max age. Anything older is treated as cold and refetched on first
 *   subscribe. This bounds the staleness window for users who open the app
 *   once a week without ever connecting.
 *
 * R15 / S6-P1: the persister key is namespaced by authenticated user id so a
 * shared device cannot hydrate user A's cache into user B's session. Before
 * S6-P1 the key was resolved ONCE at module load (always ':anonymous' on
 * AsyncStorage-shim builds, because lib/userCache has not hydrated yet) and
 * could never be swapped, so isolation rested on purge-on-sign-in/out plus
 * queryClient.clear(). S6-P1 removes the import-time singleton: persistence is
 * created per committed identity by `createIdentityPersistence()` and owned by
 * `PersistedQueryCacheGate` (RootNavigator supplies the committed bootstrap
 * identity). There is no persistence at all for the logged-out state.

/**
 * Settle and clear the in-memory query cache at an identity boundary
 * (sign-out, identity replacement, committed logout).
 *
 * Why not a bare `queryClient.clear()` (traced in the pinned
 * @tanstack/query-core 5.100.14 sources; observed in S6-C6 as two 600 000 ms
 * timers created via `Query.removeObserver → scheduleGc` that survived
 * `cancelQueries()` + `clear()`):
 *
 *   1. `QueryCache.clear()` → `remove(query)` → `query.destroy()` clears the
 *      gc timer, silently cancels the retryer and deletes the map entry — but
 *      it does NOT detach observers. Every still-mounted `useQuery` keeps its
 *      `QueryObserver` pointed at the now-orphaned Query object.
 *   2. Later, `Query.removeObserver()` runs on that orphan — from
 *      `QueryObserver.destroy()` when the screen unmounts, or from
 *      `QueryObserver.#updateQuery()` on the observer's next render — and,
 *      because the observer list becomes empty, calls `scheduleGc()`: a
 *      gcTime (600 000 ms) timer on an object no longer in the cache, which
 *      nothing can clear. `removeObserver()` is a no-op for an observer that
 *      is not in `query.observers`, so detaching observers while the query is
 *      still cached makes every later call inert.
 *   3. `Query.#fetch`'s `finally { scheduleGc() }` runs when the retryer
 *      settles. `destroy()`'s silent cancel settles it AFTER `clearGcTimeout`,
 *      i.e. it re-arms on the orphan as well. `cancelQueries()` settles the
 *      fetch while the query is still cached (its `finally` runs before the
 *      cancel promise resolves), so the re-armed timer is then cleared by
 *      `destroy()`.
 *
 * Privacy is not weakened: the cache is still emptied synchronously at the
 * end of this call; the extra steps only ensure the emptied objects are truly
 * released instead of leaving observed orphans behind. Nothing here shortens
 * gcTime or masks timers. The detached observers re-attach to fresh Query
 * objects on their next render (or are destroyed on unmount) exactly as after
 * a plain `clear()`.
