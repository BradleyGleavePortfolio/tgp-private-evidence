-- S1-DB-01 — close the 18-relation public RLS exposure, protect current AND
-- future community_messages partitions, and pin the mutable search_path on the
-- four advisor-flagged functions.
--
-- PROVENANCE: NEW candidate written 2026-09-20 from preserved main c23b9d9f
-- (execute/20260920-s1-database). It does not inherit any prior candidate's
-- audits or runtime proof.
--
-- WHAT WAS OBSERVED (fresh Supabase metadata, 2026-09-20 15:50 UTC, read-only):
--   18 public relations had relrowsecurity = false AND effective SELECT/INSERT/
--   UPDATE/DELETE for both PostgREST API roles (anon, authenticated). Four of
--   them are partitions of "community_messages"; the PARENT has RLS + FORCE
--   enabled, but partition tables do NOT inherit the parent's relrowsecurity
--   flag or its policies, so a direct request against
--   /rest/v1/community_messages_2026_12 was not policy-constrained. The
--   partitions were created by CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION OF, which picks up
--   Supabase's ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (ALL to anon/authenticated/service_role)
--   — that is where the CRUD grants came from.
--
-- CALLER MAP (source review of backend c23b9d9f, mobile a5933fd6, importer
-- 0111be66): every one of the 14 non-partition tables is reached ONLY through
-- the backend's Prisma client (server-side; the app's DATABASE_URL role is
-- postgres or service_role per source comments — BOTH are BYPASSRLS, and the
-- app already reads dozens of FORCE-RLS/service_role-only tables such as
-- MarketplaceAbuseSignal, so a non-BYPASSRLS serving role would already be
-- broken today). No repository issues PostgREST (.from()) or realtime
-- postgres_changes calls against any of the 18 relations; mobile uses Supabase
-- only for auth and broadcast channels. Therefore denying anon/authenticated
-- removes no legitimate caller. The actual runtime serving role is still an
-- EXTERNAL verification gap (see execution/s1-database/RUNTIME_ROLE_VERIFICATION_PACKET.md);
-- this migration is designed to be a no-op for any BYPASSRLS role and for
-- service_role, and to be applied only after that gap is closed.
--
-- PATTERN: identical to the repository convention established in
-- 20261220000000_talent_marketplace_rls / 20261220000020_marketplace_abuse_signal_rls:
--   ENABLE + FORCE RLS; PERMISSIVE FOR ALL TO service_role; RESTRICTIVE
--   deny-all TO anon and TO authenticated. Additionally table privileges are
--   REVOKEd from anon/authenticated (belt AND braces — RLS alone still
--   advertises the relation through PostgREST; a revoke does not). Nothing is
--   granted that was not already granted. No "USING (true)" is added for any
--   API role. WearableProcessedEvent (RLS enabled, no policies) is deliberately
--   left alone: deny-by-default is the intended boundary there.
--
-- LOCK / TIMEOUT BOUNDS: ALTER TABLE ... ROW LEVEL SECURITY, REVOKE and
-- CREATE POLICY each take an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock. A long-running app
-- transaction would make this migration QUEUE and, while queued, block every
-- new query on that table. lock_timeout bounds each lock acquisition to 5 s
-- and statement_timeout bounds any single statement (the 14-table DO block is
-- ONE statement, so locks taken on earlier tables are held while waiting on
-- later ones, worst case ~5 s x 14 + work, capped at 60 s) — schedule in a
-- low-traffic window. On timeout the statement errors. Prisma sends this file
-- as ONE multi-statement simple-protocol query, which PostgreSQL runs in one
-- implicit transaction, so the WHOLE file is expected to roll back — including
-- statements that already succeeded before the failing one. That expectation is
-- ASSERTED (not assumed) by test/db/s1-rls-close-public-exposure.sh §3: it
-- holds a lock on an object touched only in the SECOND DO block, drives the real
-- `prisma migrate deploy` into SQLSTATE 55P03 mid-file, and then checks that the
-- 14-table DO block AND the CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION statements executed
-- before the failure are all gone from the catalog. Read the harness log for the
-- run that backs any given head; the comment itself is not evidence.
-- _prisma_migrations then records the failure and the Prisma recovery is
-- `prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20261224000000_rls_close_public_exposure`
-- followed by `prisma migrate deploy` (also exercised by the harness).
-- The bounds are session-level SET so they also hold when an operator runs
-- this file with `psql --single-transaction`; they are RESET at the end so
-- they do NOT leak into later migrations applied on the same connection. On
-- a failed attempt the SETs are undone by the transaction rollback (SET is
-- transactional); the harness checks both paths in one session.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT — FOR THIS MIGRATION ONLY: every statement here is safe to re-run
-- (IF EXISTS / OR REPLACE / idempotent ALTER/REVOKE), so re-applying this file
-- with `psql --single-transaction -f migration.sql` followed by verify.sql is
-- the documented forward repair when the SQL has been reversed out-of-band but
-- _prisma_migrations still says applied (see the INVARIANT note at the bottom).
-- This property is NOT a general rule for the repository: other migrations
-- (e.g. 20270118000000_scout_ledger_platform_expand deliberately REFUSES a
-- re-run once its column exists) need their own state-specific recovery.
--
-- PRECONDITIONS relied on, not established (verified as ALLOWED-PATH by
-- verify.sql): service_role already holds SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on every
-- target relation (Supabase default privileges), and the executing role owns
-- the relations. "Nothing is granted that was not already granted" below is
-- exactly that statement — this file adds no table GRANT for service_role.
