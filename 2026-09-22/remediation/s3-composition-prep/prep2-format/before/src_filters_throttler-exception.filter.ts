/**
 * ThrottlerExceptionFilter — formats 429 Too Many Requests responses.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Always sets a `Retry-After` header (integer seconds). The value is the
 *   largest TTL window across all named throttlers — a conservative upper
 *   bound that tells the client the maximum it would need to wait. We do NOT
 *   expose which specific named throttler fired (that would leak internal
 *   limit details that could help an attacker craft requests that maximize
 *   throughput right up to each bucket's edge).
 * - Returns a generic JSON body. No echo of the user's input. No exposure of
 *   bucket names, actual limits, or current counter values.
 * - The body shape is intentionally identical for every throttler so a
 *   probing attacker cannot distinguish "login rate limited" from "default
 *   rate limited".
 * - Emits a structured log line on every rejection so operators can spot
 *   credential-stuffing patterns, runaway clients, and misconfigured limits.
 *   The log contains internal context (userId, ip, path, method, retryAfter)
 *   that is deliberately NOT echoed in the client response.
 * - Increments a `throttler_rejected_total` Prometheus counter (when the
 *   observability MetricsService is wired in). The counter is labelled by
 *   `method` and `path` for blast-radius analysis; user/IP are intentionally
 *   omitted to keep label cardinality bounded.
 *
 * 429 body shape:
 * {
 *   "statusCode": 429,
 *   "error": "Too Many Requests",
 *   "message": "Too many attempts. Please wait before trying again.",
 *   "retryAfter": <seconds: integer>
 * }
 *
 * The `Retry-After` header value matches `retryAfter` in the body so that
 * both standards-compliant HTTP clients and human-readable responses agree.
