# Observability Module

Production-grade observability for The Growth Project backend.  This module
owns structured logging, request tracing, Prometheus metrics, deep health
checks, and CPU profiling.  It must be the **first import in AppModule** so
the request-id middleware runs before every auth guard and audit interceptor.

---

## Purpose

A running NestJS process in production needs four things so problems can be
found and fixed quickly:

1. **Structured logs** — every line is a JSON object with a fixed shape so a
   log-aggregation backend (Better Stack, Datadog, etc.) can index it.
2. **Request tracing** — a unique `X-Request-ID` ties every log line from a
   single HTTP request together.  Support engineers copy the ID from a mobile
   client error response and pull all the server logs for that request.
3. **Metrics** — a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint lets Grafana show request
   rates, error rates, and latency percentiles in real time.
4. **Health checks** — `GET /health/deep` lets ops tooling (uptime monitors,
   on-call alerts) distinguish a database outage from a process crash.

An optional **CPU profiler** endpoint (`GET /debug/profile`) is gated behind
the OWNER role and a feature flag so it is never accidentally exposed.

## Log shape

Every JSON log line contains these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp` | string (ISO-8601 UTC) | When the line was emitted |
| `level` | `"log"` \| `"warn"` \| `"error"` \| `"debug"` \| `"verbose"` | Severity |
| `context` | string? | NestJS class / module name (e.g. `"HTTP"`, `"Bootstrap"`) |
| `request_id` | string? | X-Request-ID for the current HTTP request (set by middleware) |
| `user_id` | string? | Supabase UUID of the authenticated user (set by LoggingInterceptor) |
| `method` | string? | HTTP method (`"GET"`, `"POST"`, …) — on request-end lines only |
| `path` | string? | Raw request path — on request-end lines only |
| `status` | number? | HTTP status code — on request-end lines only |
| `latency_ms` | number? | Round-trip latency in milliseconds — on request-end lines only |
| `message` | string | Human-readable log message |

Example (pretty-printed for readability — the actual line is single-line JSON):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:23:45.678Z",
  "level": "log",
  "context": "HTTP",
  "request_id": "3f7a9b1c2d4e5f60",
  "user_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/me/weight",
  "status": 200,
  "latency_ms": 34,
  "message": "GET /api/me/weight 200"
}
```

### Redaction rules

The following key names (case-insensitive) are **always replaced with
`"[REDACTED]"`** before the line is written.  The list is enforced by
`redactObject` (recursive object walk) and `redactLogLine` (belt-and-suspenders
string replacement on the serialised JSON):

```
password, passwd, pass, secret, token, authorization, x-api-key,
api_key, apikey, access_token, refresh_token, id_token, client_secret,
private_key, privatekey, ssn, social_security,
bloodwork, blood_glucose, hba1c, cholesterol, triglycerides,
body_fat, bodyfat, fat_percentage, raw_bloodwork,
stripe_secret_key, stripe_webhook_secret, card_number, cvv, cvc, card_cvc, card_cvv
```

Allowed keys that will never be redacted even if they match a prefix of the
above names: `request_id`, `user_id`, `method`, `path`, `status`,
`latency_ms`, `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `msg`.

---

## Request-ID contract

`RequestIdMiddleware` runs on every route before any guard or interceptor.

- **Incoming header present** (`X-Request-ID: <value>`): the value is sanitised
  (alphanumeric + hyphens only, max 128 chars) and used as the ID.  The mobile
  client, Fly's edge, or a test harness can supply an ID for end-to-end
  correlation.
- **No header**: a 16-byte cryptographic random hex string is generated.
- The resolved ID is:
  - Attached to `req.requestId`
  - Stored in `AppLoggerService.requestId` (module-scope thread-local)
  - Returned as `X-Request-ID` response header
  - Included in every error response body via `HttpExceptionFilter`

**Error response shape (all 4xx / 5xx):**

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "User not found",
  "error": "Not Found",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:23:45.678Z",
  "path": "/api/me/profile",
  "request_id": "3f7a9b1c2d4e5f60"
}
```

---

## Metrics

Served at `GET /metrics` (Prometheus text format 0.0.4).  No auth.

| Metric name | Type | Labels | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `http_requests_total` | counter | `method`, `route`, `status` | Total HTTP requests |
| `http_request_duration_ms` | histogram | `method`, `route`, `status` | Request latency in ms |
| `db_query_total` | counter | `model`, `operation` | Prisma queries by model |
| `redis_op_total` | counter | `command` | Redis commands (when Redis is in use) |

Histogram latency buckets: **10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000 ms**.

The `route` label uses the Express route pattern (e.g. `/api/users/:id`) rather
than the raw path so a single user's UUID does not create a new time-series.

---

## Sentry behaviour

Sentry is initialised in `src/instrument.ts` (imported first in `main.ts` so
it attaches to Node's `http` module before any request arrives).

- **`SENTRY_DSN` set**: all 5xx responses and unhandled exceptions are
  forwarded to Sentry.  4xx are deliberately skipped (validation errors and
  auth failures would flood the Sentry project with noise).
- **`SENTRY_DSN` unset**: Sentry is a no-op.  No error is thrown on boot.
- **Sample rates**:
  - `tracesSampleRate`: defaults to `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (env) or `0.1`.
  - Error capture rate: `1.0` (every unhandled exception is captured).
- **Error-event metadata boundary** (`beforeSend`): ORM failures use a static
  diagnostic envelope. Other errors retain ordinary exception/message details,
  event identifiers, release/environment, and allowlisted application tags
  (including request correlation and the HTTP route template). Automatically
  enriched request URLs, queries, headers, bodies, transaction names, breadcrumbs,
  contexts, users and extras are not forwarded on these error events.
  This boundary does not sanitize arbitrary exception/message text, source
  context in stack frames, sampled transactions/spans, or attachments. It is
  not a claim of universal telemetry privacy; those surfaces require separate
  release evidence. Client-facing error-response paths are unchanged.

---

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/metrics` | None (public) | Prometheus metrics scrape endpoint |
| `GET` | `/health/deep` | None (public) | Deep readiness: DB + Redis check |
| `GET` | `/debug/profile` | OWNER role + `PROFILE_ENABLED=on` | 30-second V8 CPU profile (`.cpuprofile` download) |

The existing shallow health endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`) are in
`src/health/` and are unchanged.  `/health/deep` lives here because it depends
on the observability module's runtime configuration.

---

## Health check shapes

### `GET /health/deep`

Success (200):
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "db": "up",
  "redis": "up",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:23:45.678Z"
}
```

Redis unconfigured (no `REDIS_URL`) (200):
```json
{ "ok": true, "db": "up", "redis": "unconfigured", "uptime": 3600, "timestamp": "..." }
```

Failure (503):
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "db": "down",
  "redis": "up",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "timestamp": "...",
  "errors": ["db: connection refused"]
}
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Tier | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | optional | Minimum log level: `error`, `warn`, `log`, `debug`, `verbose` |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `json` | optional | `json` for machine-readable (production) or `pretty` for human-readable (development) |
| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `on` | optional | `on` enables the `/metrics` endpoint and counter tracking; `off` disables both |
| `PROFILE_ENABLED` | `off` | optional | `on` activates `GET /debug/profile`.  Requires OWNER role.  Leave `off` in production unless actively profiling |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | _(unset)_ | feature | Sentry project DSN.  When unset Sentry is a no-op |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `0.1` | optional | Fraction of transactions sampled for Sentry Performance (0.0–1.0) |

---

## Prisma models touched

None.  This module adds no database tables.

---

## Test coverage

| File | What it asserts |
|---|---|
| `test/observability.spec.ts` | `redactObject`: passwords, tokens, bloodwork values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`; nested objects are walked; circular references are handled; original object is not mutated |
| | `redactLogLine`: password and authorization values in serialised JSON strings are stripped |
| | `MetricsService`: `render()` produces valid Prometheus text; `recordRequest` increments counters; histogram buckets are cumulative; disabled mode returns comment-only text |
| | `AppLoggerService`: emits JSON with required fields; includes `request_id` thread-local; redacts password in meta |
| | `RequestIdMiddleware`: generates hex id when header absent; honours incoming header; strips unsafe chars; truncates to 128 chars; resets `userId` on each request |
| | `HealthDeepController`: returns `ok:true` on DB success; returns `ok:false` + 503 on DB failure |

---

## Future work

- **Log shipping**: forward JSON stdout to [Better Stack Logs](https://betterstack.com/logs) via Fly's `[metrics]` block or a Fluent Bit sidecar.  The JSON shape is already compliant.
- **Metrics backend**: scrape `/metrics` with [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) or self-hosted Prometheus.  Add alert rules for: p99 latency > 1000ms, error rate > 1%, DB query count spikes.
- **Distributed tracing**: attach OpenTelemetry trace/span IDs to log lines and forward to a Jaeger or Tempo backend for cross-service waterfall views.
- **Sentry Performance**: bump `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` to `0.5` once traffic baselines are established.
- **prom-client**: replace the hand-rolled metrics implementation with `prom-client` (Node.js Prometheus client) and `@willsoto/nestjs-prometheus` for SDK features like push gateway, exemplars, and built-in Node.js process metrics (`process_cpu_seconds_total`, `process_resident_memory_bytes`).
- **Redis op metrics**: wire `MetricsService.recordRedisOp()` into the ioredis client used by the throttler to expose real Redis command counts.
- **Prisma query metrics**: wire `MetricsService.recordDbQuery()` into Prisma middleware (extension) to count queries per model.
