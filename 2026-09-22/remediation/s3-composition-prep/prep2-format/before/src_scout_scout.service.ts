 * IMPORTER-E — cross-device progress mirroring + terminal completion for the

 *
 * Progress is a HOT path: the worker posts a snapshot on every batch commit.
 * To keep that path cheap we coalesce snapshots in an in-process Map keyed by
 * `${coachId}:${intentId}:${deviceId}` (only the latest matters — this is an
 * upsert, not an append) and flush the dirty set to Postgres on a timer. A
 * burst of N commits for one import collapses to a single upsert per flush
 * window. device_id is part of the key so a coach mirroring one import from two
 * physical devices at once (laptop + phone) keeps two independent snapshots
 * instead of overwriting each other.
 *
 * Completion is the COLD path and must be exactly-once AND state-owning
 * (R-STATE-1): the first call atomically flips the parent ScoutImport row to
 * its terminal state AND appends the ScoutImportCompletion ledger row in one
 * $transaction, then notifies the coach and emits analytics. The ledger's
 * @@unique([coach_id, intent_id]) is the idempotency anchor — a retry after a
 * network flake loses the insert race (P2002), the whole transaction rolls
 * back (so the state is never re-flipped), and the call is a silent no-op so
 * the coach is never double-notified.
