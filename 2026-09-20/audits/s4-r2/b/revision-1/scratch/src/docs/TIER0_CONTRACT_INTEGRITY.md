# Tier 0 — contract integrity and data-loss prevention

Record of the Tier 0 rung: the smallest set of changes that stop the extension
from silently losing a coach's migration or silently lying about one. Everything
here is a correctness fix against contracts that already exist on
`growth-project-backend` `main`. No new capability, no flag flip, no induction,
no product-gate change.

## 2026-09-17 pagination boundary correction

The original rung below is historical. The current boundary repair additionally
distinguishes malformed selected arrays and cursor tokens from valid source
endings, preserves earlier batches, and carries existing malformed/degraded
outcomes through partial settlement and the localized recovery warning.

The producer always supplies `truncationReasons: []` or a bounded subset of
`budget | pagination_cycle | page_ceiling`. Consumers do not guess a missing
budget reason. Malformed response shapes use `lastSkipStatus: "malformed"` and
`degraded: true`, not a new wire enum. Source JSON syntax errors keep that category;
body transport errors retain their original retry/abort category. The one source
request deadline includes headers and JSON-body consumption; native fetch refuses
redirects before following them. Raw-response users of the shared wrapper retain
their original unconsumed response contract.

Reaching a page budget is partial only if another context/page actually needs
fetching. Collected IDs remain unique and insertion-ordered without per-context
copies of accumulated child IDs. Explicit malformed restrictive budgets fail
before I/O; absent/null and oversized positive-integral default semantics remain.
See the dated addendum in `DECISION_V03_AUTONOMOUS_CRAWL.md` for the precise
descriptor and response contract and regression matrix.

Partial warning copy is in `_locales/en/messages.json`, with Chrome's
`default_locale` fallback. It reports received records, explicitly denies native
migration completion, and directs the coach to contact TGP support with the warning
before retrying. Catalog translation and terminal settlement do not certify
native promotion, mapping, or migration success.

## What was broken

| # | Defect | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `POST /api/scout/ingest/complete` sent `{ intent_id, platform }` | `terminal_status` is **required** by `ScoutCompleteDto`, and `platform` is **not on the DTO**. The backend runs a global `ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true })`, so **every** complete was a 400. Every import intent stayed `running` on the backend forever. |
| 2 | Refresh posted to `/auth/extension/refresh` | The backend's global prefix is `api` and its exclude list does **not** contain `auth`, so the real route is `/api/auth/extension/refresh`. Every refresh 404'd: a perfectly good refresh token sat in `chrome.storage.session` and was never redeemable, forcing a re-pair on every cold service-worker wake. |
| 3 | `POST /api/scout/progress` was never called | The endpoint existed and nothing used it. A long crawl was invisible server-side. |
| 4 | A clean walk yielding zero entities reported `complete` | Every request 200, every page parsed, zero records out — reported to the coach as a successful import. The overwhelmingly likely cause is adapter drift, and "import complete, 0 records" is indistinguishable from "you have no clients". This is the failure mode most able to lose a whole migration without anyone noticing. |
| 5 | 429 was classified non-retryable, and retries had no delay | A rate-limited page was dropped outright. A 5xx burned all three attempts inside one event-loop turn. Both lose data. |
| 6 | A run that **threw** was never settled | Defect 1 fixed the body of the complete call, but only on the path where `runReplay` *returns*. A source 401/403 raises `AuthLostError` and propagates, so the run left the orchestration through the catch — which broadcast `ingest_failed` and posted nothing. The coach saw a finished import; the backend intent stayed `running` forever. A source session expiring mid-crawl is the single most routine way a real import ends. |
| 7 | `final_counts` was `{ pages, entities }` | Read as the per-entity tally the field name promises, that is a count of two entity types no coach has: `pages` is not an entity, and `entities` is a run total wearing an entity's name. A coach reconciling a migration could not tell from the settled record whether their notes came across. |
| 8 | The terminal progress flush only ran on the non-failed path | A failed or thrown run went terminal with its progress series frozen wherever the rate limiter last let a report through. The backend's newest progress row for a finished intent still read as an in-flight crawl — exactly the "is my migration stuck?" ambiguity `/api/scout/progress` exists to remove. |

## What changed

- **`shared/session.js`** — refresh endpoint gains the `/api` prefix.
- **`shared/net.js`** — `parseRetryAfterMs` (both RFC 9110 forms, clamped at
  `MAX_RETRY_AFTER_MS`) and a tolerant `readHeader`.
- **`shared/replay/engine.js`** — 429 is retryable; `backoffDelayMs` gives a
  jitter-free exponential schedule that a `Retry-After` hint overrides, both
  capped at `MAX_BACKOFF_MS`; the retry loop now sleeps via the injected `sleep`;
  a new terminal status `empty` for the clean-and-zero case.
- **`shared/progress.js`** *(new)* — bounded, monotone `/api/scout/progress`
  adapter. Bounded: one post per `PROGRESS_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, never two in
  flight, ≤64 entries, every string clamped to the DTO's `MaxLength`. Monotone:
  `count_committed` is a per-entity high-water mark. Advisory: it cannot throw,
  so a progress failure can never fail an import.
- **`shared/replay/engine.js`** — `result.counts`, a per-entity tally summed by
  `entityType` across steps. Built through a `Map`, so an `entityType` of
  `__proto__` (adapter data, auto-inferred from untrusted capture in PR-C2)
  becomes a real own property instead of silently discarding its count.
- **`background.js`** — maps engine status onto the backend's terminal enum,
  sends only DTO-declared fields, settles every non-cancelled outcome —
  *including the ones that threw* — attaches `retryAfterMs` from a 429 response,
  mints a non-secret device id, wires the progress reporter, and reports
  `final_counts` as the per-entity tally. `makeSender` takes an optional `tally`
  so the legacy `start_ingest` path, whose extractor keeps no counts of its own,
  can settle truthfully too.

### The terminal flush runs on every settled path

`reporter.flush()` now precedes the settlement on the failed-result path and on
the catch path, not just on the clean one. The progress series and the settlement
are two halves of one record, so the series has to close before the intent goes
terminal — a settled intent whose newest progress row is mid-crawl is a worse
signal than no progress at all. The flush is safe to put on the failure paths for
the same reason it is safe anywhere: it is bounded (one post, clamped strings,
≤64 entries), it waits for at most one in-flight report, and it cannot throw, so
it can never cost the coach the settlement that follows it.

### Vocabulary, not a lookup chain

The engine word → `terminal_status` → popup state mapping is one `OUTCOME` table
rather than three parallel conditionals. That is the same behaviour expressed
once: adding an outcome used to mean editing a status map, a popup-state
function, and a detail function, with nothing forcing the three to agree. A
missing key now means exactly one thing — `cancelled`, deliberately not settled.

### Settling a run that threw

`settleFailed()` posts `terminal_status: failed` on the catch path, **before**
the `ingest_failed` broadcast. Ordering is the substance of the fix, not a
detail: a broadcast that lands first opens a window in which the coach has been
told the import ended while the backend still has it running, and an MV3 worker
suspended in that window never closes it.

Three constraints hold it honest:

- **`final_counts` is omitted, not guessed.** No tally exists on this path and
  the DTO makes the field optional, so nothing is asserted about what landed.
- **At most one settlement per intent.** `settlementSent` is set before the
  first complete, so a *rejected* complete on an otherwise good run is not
  re-settled as `failed` — that would record a failure for a run that did not
  fail. The run still surfaces as `ingest_failed` to the coach, because an
  unacknowledged settlement is not a confirmed import.
- **It cannot mask the real fault.** The settlement is best-effort; the coach
  still sees the source failure, and a source 401/403 still routes to a source
  re-login rather than TGP pairing.

A TGP-side auth loss is the one started intent still left unsettled, and
deliberately: the tokens a complete would carry are exactly the ones just
cleared, so the POST could only 401. Closing that intent needs a re-pair (or a
backend-side expiry), not another unauthenticated call.

### The legacy `start_ingest` entrypoint

`start_ingest` runs the hand-written TrueCoach extractor rather than the replay
engine. It is **unreachable from the shipped UI** — `popup/popup.js` only ever
sends `start_import`, and `docs/DESIGN.md` labels the CTA that would send
`start_ingest` as future behaviour — but it is still a live message handler with
real auth-gate and single-flight test coverage, so it is fixed rather than
deleted.

Three of the defects above reached it, and the fixes are not all identical:

- **Defect 6 (unsettled throw)** — fixed identically: `settleFailed()` on the
  catch path, guarded by the same `settlementSent` flag.
- **Defects 4 and 7 (false `success`, untruthful counts)** — the extractor keeps
  no tally, so this path used to post a bare `terminal_status: success` with no
  counts at all. That is defect 4 in its purest form: an extractor whose selectors
  have drifted emits nothing and the coach is told the import completed. The
  sender now keeps the tally (`makeSender`'s `tally` argument, incremented **after**
  the backend acks each batch, so it records what landed rather than what was
  attempted), and the settlement derives its status from it through the same
  `OUTCOME` table the replay path uses: an empty tally settles `empty` → `partial`
  with the same `error_summary`, and a non-empty one carries per-entity
  `final_counts`.
- **Defects 3 and 8 (progress, terminal flush)** — **not** fixed here, and this
  is a deliberate remaining gap rather than an oversight. `/api/scout/progress`
  is fed from the engine's `onProgress` hook; the extractor has no equivalent, so
  wiring it would mean adding a progress surface to the extractor rather than
  correcting a contract. A `start_ingest` run therefore posts no progress rows at
  all, which is honest-if-silent (the backend sees no series rather than a stale
  one) and cannot produce the mid-crawl-forever reading defect 8 describes. If the
  CTA ever ships, this is the work that has to ship with it.

### Status vocabularies are not the same

The engine's words and the backend's enum are distinct, and the mapping is
explicit in `background.js`:

| engine `result.status` | `terminal_status` | popup state |
|---|---|---|
| `complete` | `success` | `ingest_succeeded` |
| `partial` | `partial` | `ingest_partial` |
| `empty` | `partial` + `error_summary` | `ingest_empty` |
| `failed` | `failed` | `ingest_failed` |
| `cancelled` | *(not settled)* | `ingest_failed` |

The backend has no `complete` member and no word for `empty`. A clean-but-zero
walk is reported as `partial` with an `error_summary`, because calling it
`success` would assert the coach has no data.

`cancelled` is deliberately not settled, and the reason is narrower than "the
coach stopped it". **There is no coach-facing cancel affordance** — nothing in
`popup/` sends a stop message, and the only `controller.abort()` call site is the
TGP auth-loss callback inside `makeSender`.

That callback does **not**, in fact, produce an engine-level `cancelled` result
today. `onAuthLost()` calls `controller.abort()` and then `sendEntities` throws
`TgpAuthLostError` (name `"TgpAuthLostError"`), not an `AbortError`. The
engine's own abort check (`isAborted`, `shared/replay/engine.js`) only matches
`err.name === "AbortError"`, so this throw fails that check and is re-thrown
out of `runReplay` instead of becoming `{ status: "cancelled" }` — it never
reaches the `background.js` branch this table's `cancelled` row describes.
That branch, and the `OUTCOME[result.status] === undefined` check in
`handleStartImport`, are real, correctly-written, and safe to keep (a future
caller that genuinely returns `cancelled` from the engine is handled
correctly), but at the current integration level they are unreached: the one
live route that aborts a run is caught earlier, by `isTgpAuthLost(err)`, as a
plain throw. This is not a data-loss or security defect — routing a TGP
auth-loss straight to a friendly re-pair prompt is arguably more honest than a
settled-but-uncredentialed `cancelled` state would be — it is a correction to
this document, which previously (incorrectly) described TGP auth loss as the
route that reaches the `cancelled` branch. It doesn't: TGP auth loss reaches
the `isTgpAuthLost` branch directly, without ever producing a `cancelled`
engine result. No live route produces `cancelled` today; the branch exists for
an abort path the engine supports but nothing currently triggers.

Separately, and unaffected by the correction above: a complete posted after a
genuine TGP auth loss could only 401 anyway, since that route has already
cleared the access and refresh tokens. So even if some future change made the
`cancelled` branch reachable via TGP auth loss specifically, settling it would
still require a credential that route has deliberately already discarded.

The enum gap is real too — nothing in `success|partial|failed` describes a
deliberate stop — and it becomes the operative reason the moment a cancel button
exists, because a coach-initiated stop would then reach this branch with working
credentials. That is a contract change, not an extension change, so it is listed
out of scope below rather than guessed at now.

## The replay state machine is NOT wired here

(This was the sixth item on the original Tier-0 work list. The numbers in the
defect table above are independent of that list — they are just row ids.)

`shared/replay/state.js` is a pure transition table covering
`ready → learning → confirming → importing → terminal`. It is **not** wired in
this rung, because it is not required for the correctness of any defect above:
every fix here is a wire-format or terminal-classification fix inside the
existing single-flight orchestration, and `background.js` already tracks the one
piece of state that matters (`importInFlight`). Introducing a second state
authority alongside it would add a synchronisation surface this rung does not
need, and would touch the LEARNING/CONFIRMING states that only exist for
inference — which is gated behind the C1 server-intent freeze.

### The next exact rung

**PR-11 — replay state machine as the single orchestration authority.**
Preconditions, all of which are outside this rung:

1. **C1 server intent freezes.** The state machine's `ready` state must be
   entered from a server-issued intent, not a locally minted `imp-${Date.now()}`
   id. Wiring it against the local id would have to be redone.
2. **Durable resume/revocation lands.** The machine's value is surviving a
   service-worker death mid-`importing`; without a durable state record it is a
   more ceremonious in-memory boolean.
3. **`importInFlight` is retired in the same change.** Two authorities for "is a
   run in progress" is worse than one, so the swap must be atomic.

Scope when it lands: replace `importInFlight` with `transition()`, persist the
state alongside the snapshot, and route the popup off the machine's state rather
than off `intent.status` strings. LEARNING/CONFIRMING stay unreachable until
blueprint inference (PR-C2) merges.

## Deliberately out of scope

- **Settling a `cancelled` run.** Not reachable with a usable credential today
  (see above), and when a cancel affordance ships there is still no honest enum
  member for it. Needs a backend contract change, not an extension change.
- **`total_estimated` as a real total.** The crawl discovers pages as it walks,
  so no true total exists mid-run. The committed count is used as the only
  honest lower bound. A real estimate needs a count endpoint per entity type.
- **Distinguishing genuine emptiness from drift.** `empty` says "verify this",
  not "this is drift". Actually deciding requires the drift canary, which is a
  capture/induction concern behind the C1 freeze.
- **Per-entity genuine emptiness.** `empty` remains a whole-run test. A missing or
  non-array `itemsPath` now marks the run malformed/degraded rather than successful.
  A valid array containing zero records remains indistinguishable from a
  legitimately empty source without a prior expectation to compare against. That
  expectation is the drift canary's job — a per-entity baseline from the last
  successful run — which is the same C1-gated capture concern above. The counts
  needed to feed it are now on the wire twice — live in `progress[]` and settled
  in `final_counts`, where a drifted step shows as an explicit `0` rather than an
  absent key — so the input side of that rung is in place. What is still missing
  is only the baseline to compare them against.
- **Settling a run lost to TGP auth.** See above: no credential survives to
  authenticate the complete. Needs a backend-side expiry or a settle-on-re-pair,
  neither of which is an extension-only change.
- **Retry budget across pages.** Backoff is per-page. A source that 429s every
  page still walks every page. A run-level rate-limit circuit breaker is a
  separate, larger change.

## Standing constraints preserved

SSRF confinement (`allowedOrigins` still a required capability threaded into
`normalizeBlueprint` before any fetch), token isolation (no credential added to
disk storage; the device id is a random non-secret), consent and default-OFF
capture (untouched), TrueCoach product gates (untouched), no real-account
claims. No flag was flipped; `PAIRING_ENABLED` is unchanged.
