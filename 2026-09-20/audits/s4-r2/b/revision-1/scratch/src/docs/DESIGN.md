## 1. Goal

Site-agnostic import into TGP. A coach initiates the import from the **TGP
mobile app**, installs the desktop Chrome extension, pairs the two with a
short-lived code, and the extension pulls their entire client roster, programs,
library, and history out of whatever coaching platform they currently use —
without TGP ever holding that platform's credentials, and without the coach
doing manual CSV surgery.

- **Concrete milestone:** the top-10 coaching platforms supported end-to-end
  (roster → programs → library → per-client history), driven from the same
  locked entity envelope (`extractors/_interface.js`) and the same TGP ingest
  endpoint. The prioritised platform list and per-platform status live in
  `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Long tail:** platforms outside the top-10 are covered by a
  **BYO-extractor SDK** (public `_interface.js` package + signed side-load),
  scheduled for v1.0. Until then, any platform we cannot reach programmatically
  falls back to the **user-assisted export** path (§6) so no coach is ever
  fully blocked.

The flagship (v0.1) platform is TrueCoach, which is already implemented as a
fully autonomous API walk under `extractors/truecoach/*`. Everything in this
design generalises that pattern to a dispatcher (`detectPlatform`) + a
per-platform extractor class behind the locked interface.

---

## 2. User flow (mobile-app-initiated — locked by operator 2026-07-06)

This is the canonical flow. Do not deviate without an operator ruling. The flow
is deliberately **cross-device**: TGP identity lives on the coach's phone, the
crawl happens in desktop Chrome, and a short-lived pairing code is the only
bridge between them. There is **no inline email/password** anywhere in the
extension popup.

1. **"Import your data" CTA** inside the TGP mobile app. The coach is already
   authenticated in TGP on their phone; no re-auth is required for TGP identity.
2. **"Download extension" screen.** The mobile app renders a Chrome Web Store
   deep link plus a short URL the coach can type on their laptop. A QR code
   variant is deferred (see §8 assumptions). In-app native install prompts and
   self-hosted CRX distribution are out of scope for v0.1.
3. **Progress screen** on the mobile app, following the TGP mobile design
   system. The mobile app polls
   `POST /api/extension/pair/status` with body `{ code }` — the mobile app
   already knows the code it just minted, and posting keeps the code out of
   URLs (which leak into access logs, browser history, proxies, and APM).
   A code the caller did not mint reads as `expired`, so posting your own
   code is the only path that reveals real state.
4. **"Choose your previous site"** page on the mobile app. The coach selects
   the source platform (TrueCoach, Trainerize, My PT Hub, etc. — driven by the
   `ROADMAP.md` matrix). This selection is stored server-side against the
   pairing code so the extension knows which platform to target the moment it
   redeems.
5. **Pairing code display.** The mobile app calls
   `POST /api/extension/pair/init` with `{ chosen_platform }`. The backend
   returns `{ pairing_code, expires_at }` — a **6-digit numeric code** with a
   **short TTL** (nominal 2 minutes; exact TTL is a backend policy setting).
   The mobile app displays the code in the luxury mobile design pattern
   (large mono digits, copy-to-clipboard). QR-code display is deferred.
6. **Install & open the extension** on desktop. On first run (no valid session
   in `chrome.storage.local`) the popup renders the **pairing view**
   (`popup/pair.html` / `popup/pair.js`): a single 6-digit input with
   auto-focus and paste support. No email, no password, no signup link.
7. **Redeem the pairing code.** Submitting the code issues
   `POST https://api.tgp.coach/api/extension/pair/redeem` with `{ code }`. The
   backend, if the code is unexpired and unused, returns
   `{ access_token, refresh_token, chosen_platform }` bound to the coach's
   TGP account. Both tokens are stored per §4 (refresh in
   `chrome.storage.session`, access in memory only). The chosen platform is
   stored in `chrome.storage.local` under `session.chosen_platform` so the
   popup can render the platform-specific CTA on next open.
8. **Auto-open source platform + popup fires.** With pairing complete, the
   background worker opens the source-platform URL in a new tab
   (`chrome.tabs.create({ url: platformHomeUrl(chosenPlatform) })`) and the
   popup opens on that tab. If the coach is already logged into that source
   platform in Chrome, no further auth is required; otherwise the coach
   logs into the source platform in that tab as themselves. The extension
   reuses that logged-in session (cookies + bearer captured in-tab) — **TGP
   never sees the source platform's credentials.**
9. **"Transfer data? ETA ~2 min" CTA** in the popup. Single primary button.
   Clicking sends `{ kind: "start_ingest", ... }` to the background service
   worker. The worker starts the matched extractor. The extraction is a
   **fully autonomous API walk** — no tab navigation beyond the initial open,
   no DOM scripting, no user babysitting.
10. **Progress mirrored on both devices.** The worker broadcasts a
    `status_snapshot` on every batch commit; the popup renders per-entity
    progress rows (unchanged from earlier versions — `popup/popup.js`
    `renderProgress`). It additionally posts the same snapshot to
    `POST /api/scout/progress` so the mobile app's progress screen can update
    via its existing poll/socket path. Cross-device progress mirroring is a
    hard requirement of the mobile-first UX.
11. **Completion.** On finish, the worker fires a
    `chrome.notifications.create` toast on desktop and posts a terminal
    `POST https://api.tgp.coach/api/scout/ingest/complete` so the backend can
    flip the import to a settled state and push a completion notification to
    the mobile app.

> **"Transfer data" CTA status (ships v0.3.5).** The "Transfer data? ETA ~2
> min" CTA and its `start_ingest` message (step 9) are **future behavior**: the
> current `popup/popup.js` renders status/empty/error state and sends only
> `{ kind: "request_status" }`. When the CTA lands in the v0.3.5 build, tapping
> it sends `{ kind: "start_ingest", ... }` to the background worker, which
> resolves the stored `session.chosen_platform`, starts the matched extractor's
> autonomous API walk, and drives the progress rows (§10). The step-9 text
> above describes the intended v0.3.5 behavior, not the currently shipped popup.

---

## 3. Account binding — the token IS the binding

The bearer token issued in step 7 **is** the account binding. Every ingest
call the background worker makes carries:

```
Authorization: Bearer <extension_access_token>
```

The backend routes the payload to the correct TGP account **by token
identity** — it derives the coach/org from the token, not from any request
body field or cross-tab handshake. There is nothing to reconcile client-side.

### Pairing produces the token; nothing else does

In v0.3 there is exactly one path from "no session" to "have session":
`POST /api/extension/pair/redeem`. There is no inline login, no OAuth
redirect, no signup link in the popup. If a coach doesn't have a TGP account
yet, they create it inside the mobile app (which owns onboarding, email
verification, and terms acceptance) and then start the import flow from there.

### This replaces both the `INTENT_QUERY_PARAM` handshake and the v0.2 inline login

The Day-1 build used a **TGP-initiated** handshake via a `?tgp_intent=<id>`
query param on the source-platform URL (`INTENT_QUERY_PARAM` in
`shared/protocol.js`). The v0.2 build replaced that with an
**extension-initiated** inline login form. Neither works cross-device: TGP is
a mobile app and cannot open a desktop tab with a query param, and the
desktop popup cannot host TGP account creation without duplicating mobile-side
onboarding.

The v0.3 flow is **mobile-initiated, extension-executed, backend-brokered**:
- The mobile app declares intent and platform choice.
- The backend mints a pairing code bound to both.
- The extension redeems the code for a token bound to the same coach.
- The token thereafter carries identity.

The v0.3 flow has **no query-param handshake at all**. The import is triggered
exclusively by (a) the coach opening the desktop popup and redeeming a pairing
code, then (b) the background worker creating the source-platform tab itself
(`chrome.tabs.create`, step 8). No `?tgp_intent=<id>` is ever read or written.
The dead `INTENT_QUERY_PARAM` / `STORAGE_KEY_INTENT` constants in
`shared/protocol.js` are no longer referenced by any live path and are deleted
by the v0.1 implementation PR (this design PR is docs-only). The v0.2
`popup/login.html` and `popup/login.js` files are likewise superseded by
`popup/pair.html` and `popup/pair.js` and deleted in the v0.1 build.

---

## 4. Auth model

- **Pairing-code redemption** (operator ruling 2026-07-06). The extension has
  no login form. Its only path to a token is
  `POST /api/extension/pair/redeem { code }`, and the code is minted by the
  mobile app via `POST /api/extension/pair/init`. Codes are 6-digit numeric,
  short-TTL (nominal 2 minutes), single-use, and bound to the coach's TGP
  account plus the chosen source platform at mint time.
- **Token pair** (unchanged from v0.2).
  - `POST /api/extension/pair/redeem` → `{ access_token, refresh_token,
    chosen_platform }` on the initial pair.
  - `POST /auth/extension/refresh` → new access token (and optionally a
    rotated refresh token) given a valid refresh token. Used for **token
    rotation** and to recover from a 401 mid-crawl.
  - `POST /auth/extension/logout` → **revokes** the coach's extension refresh
    token and its rotation family. **Extension-wiring status (v0.3 RC):** this
    call is **not yet wired** in the extension. `clearTokens()` today performs a
    **local-only** clear (drops the in-memory access token and removes the
    refresh token from `chrome.storage.session`) and makes **no server-side
    revocation guarantee**; server revocation still occurs via reuse-detection
    on the next refresh (§13.4) and admin-forced revocation. Wiring the explicit
    `/auth/extension/logout` call is tracked as a follow-up; until then the code
    comment in `shared/session.js` is the source of truth and must not claim
    revocation. This resolves the prior doc/code ambiguity (the doc implied the
    call was wired; it is not).
- **Storage rules (MV3-aware).**
  - The **refresh token** is persisted in `chrome.storage.session` — a trusted,
    browser-session-scoped store that survives service-worker restarts but is
    cleared when the browser session ends. It is **never** written to
    `chrome.storage.local` or `.sync`. Rationale: `storage.session` keeps the
    only persisted secret out of on-disk storage, and its browser-session
    lifetime makes **browser restart intentionally require a fresh pair** (a
    coach who quits Chrome re-pairs from the mobile app — no long-lived bearer
    is ever left at rest on disk).
  - The **access token** is kept **in memory only** — in a background
    worker-scoped variable. It is **never** written to `chrome.storage.session`
    or `.local`. Rationale: an MV3 service worker is killed frequently and
    unpredictably; treating the access token as ephemeral avoids leaving a
    live bearer at rest.
  - **On service-worker wake**, the worker has no in-memory access token. It
    **rehydrates** by reading the refresh token from `chrome.storage.session`
    (which outlives the worker within the same browser session) and calling
    `/auth/extension/refresh` to mint a fresh access token on demand (lazily,
    on the first call that needs it). After a **browser restart** the session
    store is empty, so there is nothing to rehydrate and the popup returns to
    the pairing view.
  - If refresh itself returns 401, the worker clears both tokens and broadcasts
    `auth_required`; the popup then falls back to the pairing view. The coach
    re-initiates from the mobile app to get a new pairing code.
- **Chosen platform storage.** `session.chosen_platform` is persisted in
  `chrome.storage.local` at redeem time. It survives service-worker deaths and
  is the input to `platformHomeUrl(...)` when the worker opens the source-
  platform tab in step 8.

---

## 5. White-label taxonomy (three tiers)

Coaching platforms resell themselves under coach/gym brands in three
structurally different ways. The extension's coverage strategy differs per
tier. This section is **unchanged from v0.2** — pairing does not affect how
the extension recognises source platforms.

### Tier 1 — Cosmetic white-label

The platform hosts everything; the coach only gets a **brand subdomain**
(e.g. `theirbrand.truecoach.co`, `theirbusiness.trainerize.com`). The API,
DOM, and auth are identical to the flagship host — only the hostname prefix
changes.

- **Coverage:** *free.* A **wildcard host-permission**
  (`https://*.truecoach.co/*`) plus `detectPlatform(url)` matching on the hostname
  **suffix** picks the right extractor regardless of the brand prefix.
- **Per-brand effort:** **zero.** No new manifest entry, no new code per brand.

### Tier 2 — Domain-fronted white-label

The coach owns a real domain (e.g. `app.coachbrand.com`) whose DNS points at
the platform. Same backend, **different origin** — so a static wildcard cannot
enumerate it (we cannot list every coach's vanity domain in the manifest, and
`<all_urls>` at install time is a permission the store would reject for a
narrow importer).

- **Coverage:** `optional_host_permissions` + a popup **"Custom domain →"**
  input. The coach types their vanity domain; the extension calls
  `chrome.permissions.request()` for that specific origin (a runtime grant, not
  an install-time one), then **probes a fingerprint endpoint** on that origin
  to decide which extractor drives it.
- **Ships in:** v0.2.

### Tier 3 — Truly custom app

The coach runs a bespoke app (custom Firebase / Supabase / hand-rolled
backend). There is **no shared API or DOM** to target, so no extension coverage
is possible.

- **Coverage:** none at the extension level. Fallback is the **user-assisted
  export** path (§6). A **direct-DB migration** is offered as a *services*
  engagement (runbook only — **out of product scope**, not shipped in the
  extension).

---

## 6. User-assisted export fallback

When the extension cannot reach a platform's backend — Tier 3, an unsupported
platform, or a crawl blocked by the platform — it degrades gracefully instead
of failing. This section is **unchanged from v0.2**.

1. The popup surfaces a **per-platform export walkthrough**, sourced from
   `docs/export-recipes/<platform>.md` (this directory ships empty in v0.3
   with a single `.gitkeep`; recipes are authored as platforms are onboarded).
2. The coach performs the platform's **native export** (CSV / PDF / JSON) and
   **uploads the file(s)** to the extension.
3. The extension **parses the uploaded file** through the **same locked entity
   envelope** (`makeEntity` / `_interface.js`) and calls the **same
   `POST /api/scout/ingest`** endpoint as an autonomous crawl would.

Because the envelope and the ingest endpoint are identical, the backend cannot
tell (and does not care) whether entities arrived via crawl or via upload.
This guarantees **no coach ever loses their programs**, even on platforms we
cannot reach programmatically.

---

## 7. Hard constraints (R136 compliance)

These are **non-negotiable** design constraints. Each is sourced in
`first-principles.md`.

- **Chrome MV3 sandbox.** The background is a **service worker** that can be
  **terminated at any time**. There are **no persistent globals** across SW
  deaths. Non-secret state that must survive a wake (the chosen platform, the
  progress snapshot schema) lives in `chrome.storage.local`; the **refresh
  token** lives in `chrome.storage.session` (survives SW restarts, cleared on
  browser restart → re-pair) and the access token is rehydrated in memory via
  `/auth/extension/refresh` on wake (§4). No secret is ever written to
  `chrome.storage.local`.
- **Cross-device identity bridge is a short-lived server-minted secret.**
  A desktop Chrome extension and a mobile-native app share no origin, no
  cookies, no runtime messaging channel. The only cross-device bridge that
  does not require typing a password is a backend-brokered pairing code with
  a short TTL. This is the same primitive used by TV-app sign-ins across the
  industry; it is not a novel invention.
- **Per-site rate limits.** Respect the TrueCoach limiter (`net.js`
  `RATE_LIMIT_MS = 500`, ~2 req/s). Each platform gets its own override
  constant; the dispatcher passes the platform's rate to its extractor.
- **Locked `_interface.js` contract (v0).** The entity envelope and
  `makeEntity` signature are **locked**. They cannot change without an operator
  ruling because every downstream extractor (and the backend ingest shape)
  depends on them.
- **Cross-origin CORS.** The extension has **full-origin fetch privileges** for
  any origin listed in `host_permissions` (or granted at runtime via
  `optional_host_permissions`). It therefore does **not** need the backend to
  relax CORS — extension fetches are not subject to page-origin CORS.
- **Content Security Policy.** MV3 forbids inline `eval` and inline script.
  **All JS must be static files.** No dynamic script injection, no
  `new Function`, no remote code. Every module in this repo is a static file
  loaded by the manifest.
- **Cookies API.** Reading the source platform's session cookie (e.g. the
  TrueCoach session) uses in-tab `credentials: "include"` on same-origin fetches under host_permissions — the `cookies` API permission is **not** required and is intentionally omitted (least privilege).

---

## 8. Assumptions (R136 — challengeable, not hard)

These are working assumptions that could change without breaking the locked
contract. Each carries an R131 re-verification trigger (see
`first-principles.md`).

- **6-digit numeric codes with a ~2-minute TTL are acceptable UX.** If field
  data shows coaches mistyping codes or the TTL expiring before they finish
  installing the extension, the code length (up to 8 digits) or TTL (up to 5
  minutes) can be tuned server-side without touching the extension. QR-code
  display in the mobile app is a deferred fallback that would require the
  desktop machine to have a webcam or the coach to use their phone as a
  scanner — deliberately punted to a later release.
- **The TrueCoach REST API is stable.** Shapes are locked from **live
  captures on 2026-06-30**. Re-verify quarterly per R131 (next trigger:
  2026-09-30).
- **The backend exposes `/api/extension/pair/*` and `/auth/extension/refresh`.**
  As of the v0.3 RC these contracts are **merged**: `POST /auth/extension/refresh`
  by IMPORTER-A (#496 in `growth-project-backend`) and the pairing endpoints
  (`/api/extension/pair/redeem`, `init`, `status`) by IMPORTER-D (#502). Because
  the extension's SOLE auth path now has a live backend contract, `PAIRING_ENABLED`
  ships **true** for the RC (R109 / NO-DARK-MERGES); the
  `scripts/check-flag-discipline.mjs` gate pins it on. The one remaining
  extension-side gap is the explicit `/auth/extension/logout` wiring (§4) —
  local-only clear until then. **Production readiness caveat:** enabling the flag
  couples this build to those endpoints being live in the target environment; a
  release tag is deliberately **not** cut in this PR.
- **The inline email/password assumption from v0.2 is retired.** DESIGN.md
  v0.2 §8 listed *"coaches accept inline email/password"* as a challengeable
  assumption. v0.3 removes the inline login surface entirely, so the
  assumption no longer applies and its R131 trigger is closed.
- **The extension recognises source platforms by these exact origin patterns.**
  Static, install-time coverage is precisely two match patterns:
  `https://app.truecoach.co/*` (flagship host — `content_scripts.matches` and
  `host_permissions`) and `https://*.truecoach.co/*` (the Tier-1 brand-subdomain
  wildcard in `host_permissions`, resolved to the TrueCoach extractor by
  `detectPlatform(url)` matching on the `.truecoach.co` hostname **suffix**).
  Tier-2 vanity domains are **not** in this set at install time; each is added
  at runtime one origin at a time via `optional_host_permissions` +
  `chrome.permissions.request()` (§5 Tier 2). *R131 trigger:* re-verify this
  pattern set whenever a new platform is onboarded (each adds its own flagship +
  wildcard pair), whenever TrueCoach changes its host scheme, or at the next
  quarterly capture (2026-09-30) — whichever is sooner. A pattern that no longer
  matches a live host silently disables extraction for that origin.

---

## 9. Per-entity extractor pipeline

The extractor walks entities in a fixed order; the ordering rationale is stated
in `extractors/truecoach/identity.js`. This section is **unchanged from v0.2** —
pairing does not affect what the extractor walks or in what order.

1. **Identity** — `GET /organizations` first, so the run learns the current
   `trainerId` + `orgId`. Those ids gate the exercise-ownership filter
   (`library.js` `ownsExercise`) and are stamped as provenance onto **every**
   later entity (`identity.js` `stampProvenance`). The trainer entity is
   emitted first so the backend can attach every later entity to a known coach
   row.
2. **Clients** — paginated roster (`parse.js` `parseClientsPage`,
   `buildClientEntity`), joined with `users[]` + avatar images
   (`indexImagesByParent`) + compliance rates.
3. **Workouts** — per-client, walked by **date window** (not page number) via
   `net.js` `buildDateWindows` / `workoutsPath`, joined with `workout_items`
   (`parse.js` `buildWorkoutEntities`). Includes nutrition plans, weight
   tracking, assessments, notes, and the HTML-fragment **goal** endpoint
   (`goal.js`).
4. **Library** — org-scoped exercises (owned-only filter), warmups, cooldowns,
   programs, skeletons (`library.js`), streamed in `EXERCISE_CHUNK`-sized
   batches.
5. **Goals** — the per-client goal fragment (HTMX HTML, parsed via `DOMParser`
   in `goal.js`), emitting zero entities when all macros are unset.

The orchestrator (`extractors/truecoach/extractor.js`) composes these in order,
calling `sendEntities` per batch and `broadcastStatus` after each commit.

---

## 10. Progress protocol

- The extractor is constructed with an injected `broadcastStatus(snapshot)`.
- On **every batch commit**, the worker calls `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` with
  a `{ kind: "status_snapshot", intent, progress: [...], lastError }` message.
- The popup (`popup/popup.js`) subscribes via
  `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener` and re-renders per-entity progress
  bars. It also requests the current snapshot on open with
  `{ kind: "request_status" }`.
- **New in v0.3:** on every commit the worker also POSTs the snapshot to
  `POST /api/scout/progress` so the TGP mobile app can mirror progress on its
  in-app progress screen. Snapshot shape is unchanged; the backend echoes it
  through to the mobile app's existing poll/socket path.
- **Progress endpoint auth & ordering.** `POST /api/scout/progress` is
  authenticated with the coach's extension **Bearer**; the backend derives the
  coach/import binding from the **token identity**, never a body field. Each
  snapshot carries a **monotonic `seq`** counter per import, and the backend
  **rejects out-of-order deliveries with `409 Conflict`** so a stale or
  replayed snapshot can never regress the progress shown on either device.
- Snapshot shape is owned by the background worker and is the same object the
  popup already renders — this design does not change it.

---

## 11. Testing

- **Pure parsers** in `extractors/truecoach/parse.js` (and the other pure
  modules) are unit-tested directly against **recorded fixtures**. The locked
  response shapes live in `truecoach_samples/*.json`. **Note:** that fixtures
  directory is **not part of this repo** — it is an external dependency of the
  test harness (flagged so the operator can wire it into CI).
- **Integration tests** drive the extractor class with injected
  `sendEntities` / `broadcastStatus` spies and a **fixed `now`** clock (so
  `net.js` `buildDateWindows` is deterministic), replaying recorded fixtures
  through the same code path the runtime uses.
- **New in v0.3:** `popup/pair.js` is unit-tested with a mocked fetch against
  a fixture for `POST /api/extension/pair/redeem`. Success returns a token
  bundle and drives the popup into the "chosen platform" view; failure
  (expired code, already-used code, wrong code) drives the popup back to the
  6-digit input with the appropriate error string. No test may reach the
  live network.
- No test may reach the live network; the `now` injection and fixture replay
  keep runs hermetic.

---

## 12. What ships in v0.1 vs later

Full matrix in `ROADMAP.md`. Summary:

- **v0.1 (build next):** TrueCoach flagship + Tier-1 WL subdomains, pairing-
  code UI (`popup/pair.html` / `popup/pair.js`), MV3 service worker,
  autonomous crawl, progress UI (with mobile mirroring via
  `/api/scout/progress`), completion notification.
- **v0.2:** Tier-2 custom-domain flow (`optional_host_permissions` +
  fingerprint probe).
- **v0.3+:** additional platforms (one at a time, API-verified) and the
  user-assisted export fallback for platforms we cannot crawl.
- **v1.0:** BYO-extractor SDK.

### Future files (not yet in the repo)

The following paths are referenced normatively above but are **added by the
v0.1 implementation PR**, not this docs-only design PR (paths follow the repo's
existing `popup/` layout):

- `popup/pair.html` — first-run pairing view: single 6-digit input with
  auto-focus/paste. Extension nonce last-4 (§13.3) deferred to v0.4.
- `popup/pair.js` — redeem call + pairing-view state machine, unit-tested per
  §11.

The legacy `popup/login.html` and `popup/login.js` are **superseded** and are
deleted by the v0.1 build; the current repo still carries them until then.

---

## 13. Pairing & token security model

The pairing code is a short-lived bearer secret bridging two devices, so the
backend endpoints that mint, poll, and redeem it carry the full security
weight of the flow. The requirements below are **normative** for the TGP-side
pairing endpoints (`growth-project-backend`); the extension side only needs to
honour the client obligations called out per subsection.

### 13.1 Redeem brute-force protection

A 6-digit numeric code has only 10^6 possibilities, small enough to attack
within the TTL if `/api/extension/pair/redeem` is reachable without limits.
The backend MUST enforce, as non-negotiable requirements:

- **Per-IP limit:** ≤ 10 redeem attempts per minute per source IP, with
  exponential backoff on repeated failures from the same IP.
- **Per-code cap:** ≤ 5 total redeem attempts against any single code. On the
  5th failed attempt the code is **permanently burned** — marked terminal so
  no further attempt (correct or not) can ever redeem it, and the mobile app
  must mint a fresh code.
- **Global anomaly limit + alerting:** a global redeem-failure rate ceiling
  that trips alerting, so a distributed guessing campaign across many IPs is
  detected even when each IP stays under its own budget.

Client obligation: none — this is backend-enforced. The extension surfaces the
generic failure states from §13.6 without exposing attempt counters.

### 13.2 Atomic single-use redemption (compare-and-swap)

Single-use redemption MUST be an **atomic compare-and-swap** on the pairing
record, not a read-then-write. The redeem handler executes a single
conditional update that both claims and returns the row:

```sql
UPDATE extension_pairing
   SET used_at = now()
 WHERE code = $1
   AND used_at IS NULL
   AND expires_at > now()
RETURNING coach_id, chosen_platform;
```

- Exactly one caller can win: two concurrent redeems for the same code race on
  the same row; the `used_at IS NULL` predicate lets only one `UPDATE` affect a
  row, and the loser gets zero rows back → `already_used`.
- The row is claimed and read **in the same statement** — there is no window
  between checking and consuming the code.
- Exactly one token pair is issued per code, only on the update that returns a
  row. No row returned ⇒ no token minted.

### 13.3 Anti-phishing extension nonce — **deferred to v0.4**

A displayed 6-digit code can be phished: a fake page could ask the coach to
type it and redeem it from an attacker's client. A future `v0.4` design will
add a side-by-side extension-generated nonce confirmation (extension generates
a random nonce, sends it on redeem, backend echoes the last-4 to the mobile
app, coach visually confirms both codes match).

**Current v0.3 protections** — layered defenses against the same threat until
nonce ships:

- Short TTL (nominal 120 s, clamped 30–300 s) → narrow phishing window.
- Per-code lockout after 5 failed redeems (survives across IPs) → burns down
  a leaked code fast.
- Per-IP redeem throttle (10 / min default) → caps brute-force parallelism.
- Constant-time compare on the code → no timing oracle.
- Uniform failure body (`expired | already_used | invalid | locked`) → no
  distinguishable oracle for code state.
- Coach-role and account-state re-check inside token mint → a compromised
  redeem cannot bootstrap a session for a demoted/deleted account.

A phished code is still redeemable inside its short live window, so the coach
UX in the mobile app already recommends re-minting if the extension does not
pair within ~30 s of code display — the operator ruling to keep v0.3 shipping
accepts this residual risk for the two-minute pairing window.

### 13.4 Token threat model

The refresh token is long-lived and persisted, so its handling is spelled out
explicitly:

- **Revocation trigger.** Tokens are revoked on coach logout
  (`POST /auth/extension/logout`, §13.7 / §4) and on admin-forced revocation
  (operator or security response). Revocation invalidates the refresh token
  server-side immediately; the next refresh fails and the extension clears
  local state and returns to the pairing view. **v0.3 RC caveat:** the extension
  does not yet *initiate* `/auth/extension/logout`; local logout is a local-only
  `clearTokens()` (§4). Server-side revocation therefore currently flows from
  reuse-detection on the next refresh and admin-forced revocation, not from an
  extension-initiated logout call.
- **Rotation cadence.** The refresh window matches the Supabase default; every
  `POST /auth/extension/refresh` MAY return a rotated refresh token, and the
  extension replaces the stored one atomically. Access tokens are short-lived
  and minted on demand.
- **Key material storage.** The access token lives **in memory only**, never
  `chrome.storage.session` or `chrome.storage.local`. The **sole** persisted
  secret is the rotating refresh token in `chrome.storage.session` (required to
  survive an MV3 service-worker restart within a browser session, §4); it is
  narrowly scoped to the extension audience and single-use per rotation. Nothing
  secret is ever written to `chrome.storage.local`, and `storage.session`'s
  browser-session lifetime means a browser restart clears it → intentional
  re-pair.
- **Stolen-refresh mitigation.** Refresh tokens are **single-use with reuse
  detection**: presenting an already-rotated refresh token is treated as a
  compromise signal → the backend **revokes the entire token family** for that
  coach, forcing a fresh pair from the mobile app.
- **Message-surface hardening.** Tokens are never sent to content scripts or
  page contexts. The background worker validates `sender` on every runtime
  message and rejects any token-bearing message that does not originate from
  the extension's own trusted surfaces. On uninstall/logout all token state is
  cleared.

### 13.5 Code-in-body status polling (opaque handle deferred to v0.4)

The mobile app polls pairing status by `POST /api/extension/pair/status` with
the code in the **body**, not the URL. POST-in-body is the current mitigation
for the concern that a code in a query string would leak into access logs,
analytics, browser history, and intermediary tooling.

- `POST /api/extension/pair/init` returns `{ pairing_code, expires_at }`.
- `POST /api/extension/pair/status` takes `{ code }` in the body; the endpoint
  is scoped to the authenticated mobile session that minted the code, and a
  code the caller did not mint reads as `expired` (never confirms another
  coach's code).
- The 6-digit code never appears in a status URL.

**v0.4 direction:** replace the code-in-body poll with an opaque `pairing_id`
handle returned from `init` alongside the code, so the code itself does not
travel on every poll. Deferred here to keep the v0.3 wire small and shipping.

### 13.6 Constant-time compare and generic failures

The backend MUST look up and compare the 6-digit code in **constant time**, so
that response latency does not leak whether a code is valid, expired, or
already used. Concretely:

- Constant-time comparison of the submitted code against the stored value; no
  early-return on first mismatched digit.
- **Coarse client-facing failure taxonomy.** The extension receives one of
  four terminal signals — `expired | already_used | invalid | locked` — for
  UX routing per §11. These are surfaced in the error body's `code` field so
  the extension popup can map each to the right user-facing string. Finer
  distinctions (e.g. which lockout counter tripped, which claim path lost the
  race) are written **only** to authenticated server-side audit logs, never
  exposed as a distinguishable external oracle.

## 14. Recovery & edge-case UX

The cross-device flow spans a mobile app, a desktop browser, and a
third-party source platform, so the following non-happy-path states are
**normative** UX, not future polish.

### 14.1 Pairing-code TTL recovery

The pairing code has a nominal 2-minute TTL, but installing/opening the
extension can take longer. If the coach lands on the pairing view past
`expires_at`:

- The **mobile app** shows an **expired-code screen** with a visible countdown
  while the code is live and, on expiry, a single **"Generate new code"** tap
  target. Tapping it re-calls `POST /api/extension/pair/init` and **re-mints**
  a fresh `{ pairing_code, expires_at }`, resetting the status poll. Any
  prior live code for that coach is invalidated on re-mint (backend expires
  it at the moment the new code is created).
- The **extension** pairing view, on an `expired` redeem result, returns to the
  6-digit input with a "code expired — generate a new one on your phone"
  message rather than a dead-end error.

### 14.2 Mobile step-up / re-auth mid-import

If the coach's **TGP mobile session** hits step-up auth (2FA challenge,
re-authentication, or session expiry) while an import is running, the
extension's token operations against TGP begin failing even though the crawl
itself is healthy. In that case:

- The extension detects the TGP-side auth failure (a refresh/ingest call that
  cannot recover via `/auth/extension/refresh`) and shows a dedicated
  **"Reconnect on your phone"** state, pausing ingest rather than erroring out.
- The coach clears the step-up challenge in the TGP mobile app; the extension
  resumes on the next successful token refresh without losing crawl progress.

### 14.3 Mobile ↔ extension clock-drift handling

The desktop and the phone can have materially different local clocks, so TTL
and expiry decisions MUST NOT be made against the local device clock:

- The extension **trusts the server `expires_at`** returned via
  `GET /api/extension/pair/status` (and the redeem/init responses) as the sole
  authority on whether a code is still live. It never compares the code's
  freshness against `Date.now()` on the local machine.
- Expiry is ultimately enforced **server-side** at redeem time (§13.2's
  `expires_at > now()` predicate); the client-side countdown is presentation
  only and is seeded from the server timestamps.

## Backend dependencies (flag for operator — create TGP-side tickets)

- **`POST /api/extension/pair/init`** — mobile app calls with
  `{ chosen_platform }`; returns `{ pairing_code, expires_at }`. Codes are
  6-digit numeric, short-TTL (nominal 2 minutes, clamped 30–300 s),
  single-use, and bound to the coach's TGP account + chosen platform at mint
  time. Delivered by IMPORTER-D (PR #502).
- **`POST /api/extension/pair/status`** — mobile app polls with body
  `{ code }` (POST to keep the code out of URLs / access logs). Returns
  `{ status: pending | paired | expired }`. A code the caller did not mint
  reads as `expired` — the endpoint never confirms another coach's code.
  Delivered by IMPORTER-D (PR #502).
- **`POST /api/extension/pair/redeem`** — extension calls **unauthenticated**
  with `{ code }`; returns `{ access_token, refresh_token, chosen_platform }`
  on success, or a structured error (`expired`, `already_used`, `invalid`,
  `locked`) on failure. Per-code lockout after 5 failed attempts and per-IP
  throttle (10/min default). Delivered by IMPORTER-D (PR #502).
- **`POST /auth/extension/refresh`** — refresh token → new access token (+
  optional rotated refresh). Delivered by IMPORTER-A (PR #496,
  `growth-project-backend`, merged).
- **`POST /auth/extension/logout`** — revokes the coach's extension refresh
  token and its rotation family. Referenced by the token threat model (§13.4)
  and the extension disconnect/uninstall path but not previously spec'd.
  **Not yet built.**
- **`POST /api/scout/ingest`** — already assumed by `_interface.js`; confirm
  it routes by bearer-token identity (no body-level account field required).
  **Backend PR (formerly PR-B) not yet built.**
- **`POST /api/scout/progress`** — per-commit progress snapshot forwarded to
  the mobile app. Authenticated with the coach's extension Bearer (coach/import
  binding derived from the token, not the body); enforces a monotonic
  per-import `seq` and rejects out-of-order snapshots with `409 Conflict`. Body
  is the same shape the popup receives via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
  **Not yet built.**
- **`POST /api/scout/ingest/complete`** — terminal completion call. Confirm
  the path and that it is idempotent per import. **Not yet built.**
