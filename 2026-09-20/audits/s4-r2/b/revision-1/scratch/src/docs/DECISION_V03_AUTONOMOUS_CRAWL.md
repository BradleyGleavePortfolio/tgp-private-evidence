## 2026-09-17 pagination boundary repair addendum

The sections below preserve the original staged-delivery decision; their
"this PR" and deferred-work statements describe that historical rung, not this
repair candidate.

**Goal and decision.** Preserve accepted records while refusing to equate a
malformed response, repeated cursor, exhausted budget, or unsafe page progression
with proven exhaustion. Repair the existing normalizer, traversal, and transport
seams rather than replace the engine or add a parallel scheduler.

- Minimal warning-only changes were rejected: they leave body hangs and repeated
  fan-out setup intact. A separate body timer was rejected: resetting the deadline
  after headers widens `requestTimeoutMs`. Selected: one optional response consumer
  within `fetchWithTimeout`'s original deadline; raw callers still receive their
  unconsumed Response. Caller cancellation remains active through body consumption.
- Remove repeated collected-ID copies: insertion-ordered Sets supply collection
  and deduplication directly. Check both page budgets before the next fan-out
  context; reaching a cap on the final required context alone is not truncation.
- Redirects are rejected by native fetch before following any hop. No extra
  permission or post-redirect credential-leak check substitutes for this boundary.
- Keep actual source semantics: absent/null/empty-string response cursors mean
  exhaustion; safe zero and negative page starts remain valid. Other cursor
  values must be strings that round-trip through URLSearchParams. This rejects
  lone surrogates without banning valid Unicode, whitespace, or reserved query text.

**Narrow descriptor contract.** Absent/null pagination keeps its defaults; an
explicit invalid style, empty/non-string/lossy parameter name, unsafe page start,
or sparse/invalid cursor path fails before I/O. A cursor path must be a nonempty
dense array of nonempty strings. `itemsPath` may be empty (root-array selection)
but must be dense and string-valued. These rules do not universally apply to
legacy `idField`, `collectAs`, `forEach`, method, or cross-style unused fields.

Budget fields absent/null retain defaults. Explicit nonpositive, fractional,
nonfinite, or wrong-type values throw before I/O instead of widening a restrictive
input. Positive integral values above each hard ceiling retain the existing
default fallback; this repair does not redefine that legacy upper-bound policy.

**Response contract.** A selected non-array or missing item path is malformed,
not an empty array. Valid earlier batches are retained; existing `degraded` and
`lastSkipStatus: "malformed"` yield `partial`, or `failed` when no records were
emitted. Actual empty arrays retain the clean `empty`/completion behavior.
`truncationReasons` is always an array from the replay producer, containing only
`budget`, `pagination_cycle`, and/or `page_ceiling`; malformed data uses the existing
degraded channel, not a new truncation category.

**Warning and proof.** Partial warnings use the extension message catalog;
`default_locale: "en"` supplies Chrome's supported fallback for untranslated
locales. The generic `incomplete` catalog reason covers a partial result without
a recognized category, without fabricating a budget reason. Copy reports records
received, explicitly says migration is not complete, and asks the coach to contact
TGP support with the warning before retrying. Tests exercise body streaming,
native local redirect refusal, lossless query roundtrips, malformed responses,
exact caps, deterministic fan-out work, and real-engine settlement/broadcast.
`npm test` explicitly rejects empty selections. No native-migration, real-account,
release-readiness, or independent-audit approval claim is made by this addendum.

## DECISION

Ship the **pure, site-agnostic contract + lifecycle** of autonomous multi-page
import: the declarative `PlatformBlueprint` contract the replay engine consumes
(`shared/replay/blueprint.js`) with its fail-closed, SSRF-confining normalizer,
and the explicit bounded state machine (`shared/replay/state.js`). Both are pure,
browser-independent modules with no `chrome.*` and no network access, fully
unit-tested against fixtures.

**Scope split (canonical LOC cap = 400).** The full end-to-end unit (engine +
schema + state + resolver + data-only TrueCoach adapter + `start_import`
orchestration in `background.js` + Start Import CTA in the popup) totals ~817
added production lines. The canonical R23/R76 cap is **400** prod LOC (the
stricter wording governs over the repo-CI default of 600). Per doctrine — *split
rather than violate caps, never request an exception* — this is a chain of
dependent PRs along clean import seams (each layer imports the one before it,
never the reverse, so no PR carries dead code):

1. **This PR (#4) — contract + lifecycle (400 prod LOC).** `blueprint.js` (300) +
   `state.js` (100). Pure data schema + fail-closed normalization (incl. SSRF
   scheme/host/origin confinement — resolution-proven template confinement, backslash/
   control-byte + all-trailing-dots loopback rejection, and a REQUIRED caller-injected
   `allowedOrigins` capability the apiBase origin must exactly match) + the
   prototype-safe bounded transition table. Nothing invokes it at runtime yet; it is
   inert by construction.
2. **Chained engine PR (PR-C1a) — the bounded replay engine** (`shared/replay/engine.js`).
   Imports the contract from this PR. Carries the JSON-tuple dedupe key and the
   honest `partial`/`failed`/`cancelled`/`complete` result status with its own
   behavioral test matrix (cycles / dup pages / timeout / abort / 401 / retry /
   backpressure / budget exhaustion / 100×). Opened against this branch, not merged
   ahead of it.
3. **PR-C1b — live wiring layer** (platform resolver, data-only TrueCoach
   verification blueprint, `start_import` orchestration in `background.js`, Start
   Import CTA in the popup). Imports the engine.
4. **PR-C2 — auto blueprint inference** (`shared/blueprint/*`).

The existing `TrueCoachExtractor` (`start_ingest`) remains untouched throughout.
This PR ships **no engine, no resolver, no orchestration, and no CTA** — those are
explicitly deferred to the PRs named above and must not be attested as shipped.

## REAL GOAL

Prove SITE-AGNOSTIC autonomous many-page import: an engine that, given only a
declarative blueprint of endpoint roles + edges (no competitor code in its core),
autonomously flips through many pages under the coach's own session, emits the
locked `_interface.js` envelopes, and drives ingest/progress/complete — bounded
and safe. NOT a TrueCoach-only mapped extractor.

## ROOT CAUSE

C1 (capture) is merged, but nothing yet *replays* observed requests across many
pages. The product core — the generic traversal engine — did not exist; the only
multi-page walker was the hand-mapped TrueCoach extractor, which is a verification
adapter, not the site-agnostic product.

## OPTIONS

1. **Minimal** — extend `TrueCoachExtractor` to a couple more entity types.
   Rejected: entrenches a competitor-specific extractor as the product core;
   violates the site-agnostic invariant; proves nothing generic.
2. **Conventional** — build blueprint *inference* (AUTO_DISCOVERY Layer 2, C2)
   first. Good, pure, testable — but it produces a blueprint nothing yet
   consumes, so it does NOT prove "autonomous multi-page import" this PR, and the
   mandated behavioral test matrix (cycles/dup pages/timeout/abort/401/retry/
   backpressure/budgets/100x) is almost entirely *replay* behavior, not inference.
3. **First-principles (SELECTED)** — build the generic **replay engine** (the
   piece that actually performs autonomous multi-page traversal), define the
   `PlatformBlueprint` contract it consumes, and the explicit bounded state
   machine that governs its lifecycle. The live wiring layer (data-only TrueCoach
   blueprint adapter for verification + resolver + background orchestration + popup
   CTA) is the immediately-following PR (PR-C1b), split out to stay within the LOC
   cap; blueprint *inference* is the subsequent PR (PR-C2) that removes the last
   site-specific descriptor and covers unknown platforms.

**Selection rationale:** Option 3 is the narrowest unit that proves the REAL GOAL
end-to-end with zero dead code, keeps the core generic (engine has no TrueCoach
knowledge), and lands within the LOC cap. The mandated tests *are* the engine spec.

## FIVE-STEP RESULT (make requirements less dumb → delete → simplify → accelerate → automate)

- **Question:** dropped a per-platform extractor framework; the product is one
  generic engine + declarative blueprints.
- **Delete:** no DOM packs, no eval, no remote code, no per-competitor endpoint
  maps in the core. No new manifest permissions (TrueCoach + api origins already
  granted; `optional_host_permissions: *://*/*` already covers future runtime
  grants).
- **Simplify:** traversal expressed as ordered `steps` + collected `id sets`
  (list→paginate→fan-out-over-ids). This single model covers pagination, detail,
  and edges without bespoke code.
- **Accelerate:** all IO injected (`fetchJson`, `emit`, `sleep`, `now`) ⇒ the
  engine is browser-independent and fully unit-testable against fixtures.
- **Automate:** bounded state machine + gates (R74/R76/banned/flags) enforce
  safety and reviewability mechanically.

## IDIOT-INDEX

Core value (generic multi-page traversal) vs. cost: engine + schema + state are
~230 prod LOC; the only site-specific cost is a ~40-line data-only TrueCoach
adapter that is deleted the moment inference lands. Index ≈ low: minimal
site-specific baggage per unit of generic capability.

## EXTREME TEST

100× scale: a 500-page list × 200-client fan-out is bounded by `maxPages` /
`maxEntities` / per-request timeout, serialized emit (backpressure), and a
per-step visited-URL set (cycle/duplicate-page proof). Test asserts the engine
issues a bounded number of requests and terminates regardless of a
pathological/looping server.

## HYPERSCALER LENS

What would Apple/Google/Notion do? A single deterministic engine (no ML, same
blueprint ⇒ same crawl), pure/testable brain, least privilege (runtime origin
grants, GET/HEAD only, credentials reused not copied), fail-closed on auth loss,
and no secret ever logged or persisted. Progress mirrored to both devices via the
existing snapshot shape.

## GOOD WITHOUT BAD

Generic capability WITHOUT: competitor code in the core (`shared/replay/*` has zero
TrueCoach knowledge; the data adapter lands in `extractors/` in PR-C1b), off-target
crawls (the normalizer confines apiBase to https + a REQUIRED caller-injected
origin allowlist — absence/empty fails closed before any network call — and refuses
IP-literal / loopback / link-local / localhost hosts (all trailing dots stripped)
and embedded credentials, validates each allowlist entry the same way, and forces
root-relative step templates. Name-resolution confinement is delegated to that
allowlist since a parse-time gate cannot resolve DNS; no static competitor map in
the core — PR-C1b must inject the observed tab origin), destructive requests (GET/HEAD only, refused at parse
otherwise), or credential exposure (design reuses the in-tab session, TGP bearer
only for ingest, no token persisted/logged). The engine, orchestration, and CTA
that make this LIVE arrive in later chained PRs; this PR ships only the inert,
fully-tested contract + lifecycle.

## EVIDENCE

- `docs/AUTO_DISCOVERY.md` §2 Layer 3 (autonomous replay), §3 flow, §7 risks.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` §7 (MV3/rate-limit/CSP/least-privilege), §9 (pipeline order),
  §10 (progress protocol + `/api/scout/progress`).
- Locked envelope: `extractors/_interface.js` `makeEntity`; ingest body:
  `shared/protocol.js` `makeScoutIngestBody`.
- Bounded transport: `shared/net.js` `fetchWithTimeout` (consumed by the engine PR).
- Behavioral proof shipped HERE: `test/replay-blueprint.spec.js` (fail-closed
  normalization: defaults, budgets, pagination, fan-out ordering, and the SSRF
  scheme/host/origin-allowlist/credential/root-relative confinement matrix) and
  `test/replay-state.spec.js` (exhaustive transition table + terminal re-arm).
- Deferred to the engine PR (PR-C1a): `test/replay-engine.spec.js` +
  `test/replay-engine-edge.spec.js` (cycles, duplicate pages, malformed JSON,
  timeout, abort mid-fetch, 401/auth loss, retry/idempotency, backpressure/budget
  exhaustion asserting `partial`/`failed` status, 100×).

## ROLLBACK / STOP

Inert by construction: this PR ships only pure data schema + a pure transition
table. Neither `blueprint.js` nor `state.js` performs any network or `chrome.*`
call, and nothing in `background.js` or the popup imports them yet (the engine that
consumes the contract lands in PR-C1a; the wiring that invokes the engine lands in
PR-C1b). They are therefore unreachable at runtime; to disable entirely, revert this
PR. No backend contract is newly required; ingest/progress/complete already exist
(backend #500/#501/#504). No release tag is cut here.

## NEXT ACTION (named dependent PRs)

**PR-C1a — Bounded replay engine** (immediate follow-up; retargeted onto `main`
after PR #4 squash-merged, so its diff is ONLY the engine + its tests + the one
contract change it needs — it never re-lands PR #4's lines). Adds
`shared/replay/engine.js`, importing the contract shipped in PR #4. It carries the
collision-safe dedupe key and the honest `partial`/`failed`/`cancelled`/`complete`
result status (a malformed page, retry-exhaustion, or a budget-truncated crawl must
NOT report ordinary `complete`), with the full behavioral test matrix. It imports
the contract and never the reverse.

Hardened at this head against the EXT-PR5 Lens A + Lens B live audits (all P2/P3
closed, each with a behavioral test):

- **Per-CONTEXT visited set** (Lens A P2-1 / P3-1). `visited` is scoped to one
  `runContext` invocation, not the whole run. Two steps that legitimately share an
  endpoint URL both execute; a static-template `forEach` step emits for every parent
  context; intra-context cursor/page cycles are still broken. Cross-context
  idempotency is the emitted-set's job.
- **Context-scoped dedupe key** (Lens B P2-1). The idempotency key is the tuple
  `[step.id, contextLabel, sourceId]` (contextLabel = the fan-out parent id). A child
  id unique only within its parent is kept distinct across parents; a same-context
  repeat (retry / replayed page) still dedupes. A JSON tuple cannot collide across a
  field boundary the way a delimiter-joined string can.
- **LOCKED envelope** (Lens B P2-2). The engine emits all four `_interface.js`
  fields — `sourceId`, `sourcePlatform` (= `bp.platform`), `capturedAt` (from the
  injected deterministic `now()`), `payload` — not a two-field partial. The docstring
  is corrected to match.
- **Threaded `allowedOrigins`** (Lens A P3-2). The REQUIRED SSRF allowlist capability
  is forwarded into `normalizeBlueprint(blueprint, { allowedOrigins })`; a
  missing/empty/off-allowlist origin fails closed BEFORE any fetch.
- **Self-referential fan-out rejected** (Lens A P3-3). `normalizeBlueprint` now
  throws when a step's `collectAs` equals its own `forEach`; the engine also snapshots
  the parent id set so a fan-out loop can never observe self-appended ids.
- **Honest progress** (Lens B P3-1). The tautological `total` field (always == `sent`)
  is dropped; progress reports only the meaningful `sent` count.
- **URL-free synthetic sourceId** (Lens B P3-2). An id-less item gets the bounded,
  deterministic key `${step.id}#${context}#${page}#${index}` — never the request URL,
  so no cursor/query token is persisted into a stored `sourceId`.
- **True per-step `maxPagesPerStep`** (Lens B P3-3). The page counter is a per-step
  aggregate across all fan-out contexts, so `maxPagesPerStep` caps the whole step
  (not N × the cap for N parents). The global `maxPages` remains the outer ceiling.

**CI reconciliation.** No `ci.yml` change is needed: `main` already machine-enforces
`PROD_LOC_CAP=400` on the `pull_request` review gate (600 on `push`). With PR-C1a
retargeted onto `main`, the PR-scoped diff is just the engine (< 400), so the 400 gate
passes; the `push` diff is likewise measured against `main` (no stacked parent), so it
is truthful too. The abandoned engine-branch commit `dfd67be` (which *skipped* the
per-PR gates on `push`) is intentionally NOT carried — skipping gates would weaken the
`push` build; `main`'s looser-cap-on-push approach is stronger and already correct.

**PR-C1b — Live wiring layer** (after PR-C1a). Adds `shared/replay/resolve.js`
(`resolveBlueprint(platform)` registry, `unknown_platform` for all others), the
data-only `extractors/truecoach/blueprint.js` verification adapter, `start_import`
orchestration in `background.js`, and the Start Import CTA in the popup — plus their
tests. This is where the wiring-layer audit findings are MANDATORY and must land:
source-`AuthLostError` must clear ONLY the source session and never the TGP tokens;
a single-flight guard must prevent concurrent `start_import` runs; `start_import`
must be gated by `isTrustedExtensionPage` (not extension-id alone); the popup
Start-Import test must exercise real behavior (not a source-grep); and the e2e path
must carry the source bearer so it truly authenticates. It imports the engine and
never the reverse.

**PR-C2 — Auto blueprint inference** (`shared/blueprint/*`, pure
`induceBlueprint(captureBuffer) → PlatformBlueprint` per AUTO_DISCOVERY §2 Layer 2
+ §4 confidence). It feeds `resolveBlueprint` for arbitrary/unknown platforms from
passively captured JSON and lets the popup's Learn→Confirm states drive the engine,
retiring the TrueCoach data adapter as the sole blueprint source.

## SCOPE DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT (this PR)

- The bounded replay engine (`shared/replay/engine.js`) — PR-C1a above; split out
  to hold the canonical 400 prod-LOC cap. Carries dedupe-key + partial-status fixes.
- Live wiring layer (resolver, TrueCoach data adapter, `start_import`
  orchestration, popup CTA) — PR-C1b above; carries the wiring-layer audit findings.
- Blueprint inference (Pass A/B/C, confidence) — PR-C2 above.
- Learn/Confirm capture UI (`popup/learn.*`) — arrives with inference; the
  LEARNING/CONFIRMING states exist in the state machine now (tested) but are
  driven only after inference lands.
- DOM/SSR fallback packs and export-recipe parsing — AUTO_DISCOVERY §5, later PRs.
- Additional platform adapters — one at a time, API-verified, or via inference.
