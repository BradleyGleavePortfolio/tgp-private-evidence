// Flag-discipline gate (R109 / NO-DARK-MERGES).
//
// The extension has exactly ONE path from "no session" to "have session":
// pairing-code redemption, gated by PAIRING_ENABLED. Shipping that flag OFF
// leaves the build with no reachable way to authenticate — a dark-merged auth
// dead-end. This gate pins the invariant mechanically: PAIRING_ENABLED must be
// declared as a boolean literal and, because its backend contract is merged,
// must be `true`. If the backend is ever rolled back the flag may be set false
// ONLY together with removing/guarding the redeem call, which this gate does not
// block — it only forbids a silent regression to a default-off sole auth path.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-flag-discipline.mjs
