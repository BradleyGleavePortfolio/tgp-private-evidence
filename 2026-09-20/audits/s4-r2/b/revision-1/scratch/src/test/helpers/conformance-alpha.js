// NON-PRODUCTION conformance adapter for the V5 multi-adapter neutrality proof
// (PR-2b). This file lives under test/ ON PURPOSE: `conformance_alpha` is a
// synthetic, structurally-independent SECOND adapter whose only job is to prove
// the SITE-AGNOSTIC replay core (shared/replay/engine.js + blueprint.js) drives a
// shape it has never seen with ZERO core changes. It is deliberately NOT wired
// into the production resolve.js registry (the engine consumes a blueprint object
// directly) and adds NO production LOC.
//
// Structural independence from TrueCoach (the falsifiable part of the proof):
//   - TrueCoach: PAGE-paginated list + single fan-out. Here: a single un-paginated
//     list that fans out into THREE CURSOR-paginated child families.
//   - String ids in four distinct shapes (ca_* / m-* / rt_* / al_*), a nested
//     `profile` object, omitted optional fields, and deterministic poison rows.
//
// The blueprint factory returns PURE DATA (asserted by a JSON round-trip test);
// makeFixtureFetch builds a deterministic fetchJson from the recorded fixture,
// keyed by the root-relative request path plus the ?after cursor.
